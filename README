WEBSITE:  http://einstein.sc.mahidol.ac.th/~scmal/LaTeX/

ADAPTED FROM:  report.cls and Thai LaTeX

REQUIREMENTS: works best on Linux or Unix operating systems with LaTeX
              and gv installed - but can also be used on Windoze
              (except for the Thai abstract page).

*** HOW TO INSTALL: ***

        Put muthesis.tar.gz in your home directory and type

tar xvfz muthesis.tar.gz

        If you are installing for the first time you will also need to type

cd muthesis

make all

        To check it is installed, type in 

./tlatgv muthesis_example

	 Hopefully the first page of a thesis should appear on your screen. 


*** TEMPLATE FILE ***

	 Look at muthesis_template.tex for an explanation.  If you are
         creating your thesis *for the first time* then you should use
         the template to start with as this contains instructions.

cp -i muthesis_template.tex mythesis.tex

         If you are just *updating* your version of muthesis.cls then just 
         look at the template file to see if anything important has changed.

*** DRAFT MODE ***
         
         When first preparing your thesis you will probably want to
         use the draft mode which only displays a single title page
         with abstract (or no title page at all), the chapters, and the
         references. See the template file for how to do this.


*** tlatgv *** (create and display a postscipt file)

	 This runs cttex, latex, dvips and gv on a file  
         e.g. tlatgv thesis         generates output from the whole thesis
         e.g. tlatgv thesis 10      generates output starting on page 10
         e.g. tlatgv thesis 10 2    generates 2 pages starting on page 10

*** tplatac *** (create and display a pdf file)

	 This runs cttex, pdflatex, acroread on a file  
         e.g. tplatac thesis         generates output from the whole thesis
         Note: (1) the pdf file created can be searched
               (2) figures cannot be in postscript format for this to work

*** IMPORTANT ***

         To get the correct numbers in the table of contents, you must run
	 latex (or tlatgv or tplatac) THREE times on your file.

*** UPDATES ***

         Before you print out the final copy of your thesis, check the
         website to make sure that you have the latest version of muthesis.cls

	 changed, contact me at the above email address.
