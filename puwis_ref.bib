abstract = {The Puga area in eastern Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, is known to be the most promising geothermal field in India, as pointed out by geo-scientific studies in the area. However, lack of deep subsurface information put constraints to the geothermal resource evaluation in Puga. The recent magnetotelluric study in Puga revealed anomalous conductive (similar to 5 Ohm.m) structure at a depth of 2 km in the area of geothermal manifestation. Analysis of temperature logs indicated a high temperature (similar to 260 degrees C) associated with the anomalous conductive structure and signifies potential geothermal resource in the area. We discuss the results in the context of geothermal resource utilization for power generation in the area.},

abstract = {Paleomagnetic samples of red sandstones were collected at 16 sites from the Lower to Upper Jurassic Phu Kradung formation and the Upper Jurassic Phra Wihan formation around Nan City (19.2??N, 101.0??E) in the southern region of the Shan-Thai block. After stepwise thermal demagnetization, a high-temperature component with an unblocking temperature of about 680 ??C is isolated from 11 sites. We interpret this to be a prefold characteristic remanent magnetization because of a positive fold test at the 95\% confidence level. The tilt-corrected mean paleomagnetic direction from 11 sites is D = 32.3??, I = 33.3??, ??95 = 12.2??, k = 15.0, which gives a paleomagnetic pole for this area of 60.1??N, 186.5??E with A95 = 11.7??. Compared with a Jurassic paleopole for the stable part of the Yangtze block, we observe a clockwise tectonic rotation of 12.8??, which is similar to the observed rotation (18-28??) of the northern region of the Shan-Thai block. This amount contrasts with a large rotation of more than 45?? that is estimated from the narrow zone extending from Luxi to Mengla in the central region of this block. This declination aspect suggests that a coherent whole block rotation by about 20?? of the Shan-Thai block took place in an earlier phase during indentation of India into Asia and that an internal deformation with additional local rotation between 25?? and 77?? followed within a limited zone in the central part. The internal deformation of the Shan-Thai block absorbed the stress on the Asian continent induced by indentation of India as well as its coherent whole block motions of clockwise rotation and southward displacement. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Wideband magnetotelluric (MT) soundings were carried out on Mt. Fuji volcano along a northeast to southwest axis. It was found by two-dimensional inversion using the highest quality data (in the frequency range 1–300 Hz) that a good conductor (resistivity of approximately a few ohm m) was located beneath the summit with a lateral extent of approximately 4 km. It begins approximately 1 km below the ground surface; however, its depth cannot be resolved. In our previous study, an intense positive self-potential (SP) anomaly (approximately 2000 mV), was found around a summit crater having a diameter of approximately 3 km. We interpreted the presence of the good conductor and positive SP anomaly as a strong indication of an active hydrothermal system. Subsequently, we searched for conduction current sources to explain the SP distribution on the surface by using the resistivity structure determined by the MT inversion. The results obtained were that a positive conduction current source of the order of 1000 A should be located at the top of the conductor. From these results, we deduced that the conductor represents a hydrothermal system in which single-phase (liquid) convection is taking place. Since the resistivity at a distance from the good conductor can be explained by the effect of cold groundwater, the hydrothermal system does not seem to extend throughout the entire body of the volcano, but seems to be confined to the area beneath the summit crater. Finally, an estimate of the order of magnitude of the subsurface hydrothermal flow was performed using a relation between the fluid volume flux and electric current density in the capillary model. The result suggested that there exists fairly low permeability within the shallow part of Mt. Fuji. We speculate that the low permeability in the volcano has a correlation with the confinement of the hydrothermal system and quiescence of volcanic activities, such as low seismicity, no gas emanations, and no natural hot springs.},

abstract = {Continuous magnetotelluric (MT) measurements were conducted from May 2008 to July 2009 at Sakurajima, one of the most active volcanoes in Japan. Two observation sites were established at locations 3.3km east and 3km west–northwest of the summit crater. At both observation sites, the high-quality component of the impedance tensor (Zyx) showed variations in apparent resistivity of approximately ±20\% and phase change of ±2°, which continued for 20–180days in the frequency range between 320 and 4Hz. The start of the period of changes in apparent resistivity approximately coincided with the start of uplift in the direction of the summit crater, as observed by a tiltmeter, which is one of the most reliable pieces of equipment with which to detect magma intrusion beneath a volcano. A 2D inversion of MT impedance suggests that the resistivity change occurred at a depth around sea level. One of the possible implications of the present finding is that the degassed volatiles migrated not only vertically through the conduit but also laterally through a fracture network, mixing with shallow groundwater beneath sea level and thereby causing the observed resistivity change.},

During this event, GPS and tiltmeters detected syn-eruptive ground subsidence approximately 7 km to the WNW of the volcano. Starting in March 2011, we conducted broad-band magnetotelluric (MT) measurements at a site located 5 km NNW of the volcano, beneath which the Shinmoe-dake magma plumbing system may exist. In addition, temperature monitoring of fumaroles and hot-springs near the MT site was initiated in July 2011. Our MT data record changes in apparent resistivity of approximately ±5\%, along with a ±1° phase change in the off-diagonal component of the impedance tensor (Zxy and Z yx). Using 1-D inversion, we infer that these slight changes in resistivity took place at relatively shallow depths of only a few hundred meters, at the transition between a near-surface resistive layer and an underlying conductive layer. Resistivity changes observed since March 2012 are correlated with the observed temperature increases around the MT monitoring site. These observations suggest the existence beneath the MT site of pathways which enable volatile escape.},

abstract = {Asama volcano is an active volcano with many historical records of Vulcanian eruptions. Its most recent eruptions occurred in 2004 at the summit crater. In this paper, we argue the resistivity structure shallower than 3 km obtained by a dense magnetotelluric survey. The magnetotelluric data were obtained at 74 measurement sites mainly along the four survey lines across the volcano. The resistivity profiles obtained by two-dimensional inversions are characterized by a resistive surface layer and an underlying conductive layer. The dominant feature of the profiles is the existence of resistive bodies at a depth range of a few hundred meters to a few kilometers surrounded by a highly conductive region. Considering that the location of resistive bodies correspond to the old eruption centers (one corresponds to the 24 ka collapse caldera and the other to the 21 ka lava dome), the resistive bodies imply zones of old and solidified intrusive magma with low porosity. Because geothermal activities exist near the resistive bodies, the enclosing highly conductive regions are interpreted as a hydrothermal system driven by the heat from the old solidified magma. Beneath the resistive body under the collapsed caldera, intrusion of magma is inferred from the studies of volcano-tectonic earthquakes and continuous global positioning system (GPS) observation, implying the structural control of magma activity within the volcano. In this study, we propose that the magma ascent was impeded by the old and solidified remnant magma and partly migrated horizontally to the east and finally ascended to the summit, resulting in the 2004 eruptions.},

abstract = {Magnetotelluric (MT) measurements were conducted at Iwate volcano, across the entirety of the mountain, in 1997, 1999, 2003, 2006, and 2007. The survey line was 18km in length and oriented E–W, comprising 38 measurements sites. Following 2D inversion, we obtained the resistivity structure to a depth of 4km. The surface resistive layer (\~{}several hundreds of meters thick) is underlain by extensive highly conductive zones. Based on drilling data, the bottom of the highly conductive zone is interpreted to represent the 200°C isotherm, below which (i.e., at higher temperatures) conductive clay minerals (smectite) are rare. The high conductivity is therefore mainly attributed to the presence of hydrothermally altered clay. The focus of this study is a resistive body beneath the Onigajo (West-Iwate) caldera at depths of 0.5–3km. This body appears to have impeded magmatic fluid ascent during the 1998 volcanic unrest, as inferred from geodetic data. Both tectonic and low-frequency earthquakes are sparsely distributed throughout this resistive body. We interpret this resistive body as a zone of old, solidified intrusive magma with temperatures in excess of 200°C. Given that a similar relationship between a resistive body and subsurface volcanic activity has been suggested for Asama volcano, structural controls on subsurface magmatic fluid movement may be a common phenomenon at shallow levels beneath volcanoes.},

abstract = {There are many potential sites for geothermal power plants in Thailand. After many years of geological and geophysical surveys, a pilot magnetotelluric (MT) survey was made to assess the reservoir of the Mae Chan geothermal area, northern Thailand, which is one of the key areas for geothermal development. Seven MT sites were deployed in a 3km×4km area around the Mae Chan district covering the Mae Chan hot springs. The MT data were acquired at low and high frequency ranges and were inverted using a 3-D MT inversion to yield the 3-D resistivity structure of the area. The results show that there are two conductive zones near the surface associated with the hot fluid of the Mae Chan hydrothermal system. The hot fluid reservoir mostly resides at less than 500m below the surface in weathered and fractured granite and in the overlying sedimentary deposits. Its source rock is imaged as a resistive zone corresponding to the hot granite batholith below it. The hot fluid rises up along the Mae Chan fault. The fault is clearly observed as a resistivity contrast extending from the surface to depth. It dips at a moderate angle. From the measured temperature of the fluid from a drill hole and the estimated temperature of the granite rock from the resistivity structure we conclude that the Mae Chan geothermal area is likely to be suitable for immediate development of a small-scale geothermal power plant.},

The 3D inversion was based on full MT impedance tensors previously corrected for static shift. Both inversion approaches gave qualitatively similar results, and revealed a shallow resistivity layer reflecting conductive alteration minerals at temperatures of 100–240°C. They also delineated a deep conductor at 3–10km depth. The reason for this deep-seated high conductivity is not fully understood. The distribution of the deep conductors correlates with a positive residual Bouguer gravity anomaly, and with transform tectonics inferred from seismicity. One model of the Hengill that is consistent with the well temperature data and the deep conductor that does not attenuate S-waves, is a group of hot, solidified, but still ductile magmatic intrusions that are closely associated with the heat source for the geothermal system.},

abstract = {Widespread definition of a groundwater system in three dimensions is necessary for the management and maintenance of groundwater resources. A magnetotelluric (MT) survey can be an effective geophysical prospecting method for imaging regional geological structures by measuring both shallow and deep resistivity. To demonstrate the capability of an MT survey to characterize a groundwater system, the Kumamoto area of central Kyushu in southwestern Japan was selected as a case study site because of its rich groundwater resources. Three-dimensional (3D) MT resistivity structure to a depth of 5 km was modeled by 1D inversion analysis of raw MT data and 3D interpolation of the resultant resistivity column data by the optimization principle method. Consequently, both deep and shallow aquifers were detected. A high-resistivity zone appears at depths between 500 and 2,000 m between the Futagawa–Hinagu faults and the Usuki–Yatsushiro tectonic line, which supports the existence of an aquiclude under the aquifer. The most important characteristic inferred from the 3D resistivity model is that the deep groundwater system below a depth of 1,000 m has two main flow paths. One path is likely to be through porous rocks because the low resistivity zone is regarded as tuff with sand and gravel, and the other flow path is interpreted to be through fractured zones along the Hinagu faults. Hence, the path and direction of the groundwater flows are probably controlled by geologic structures and the configuration of the active faults. These findings support the effectiveness of the MT method for investigating groundwater systems.},

abstract = {This study provides an evaluation of the utility and resolution of different geoelectrical methods in mapping contaminant distribution in the subsurface, and provides a window into the processes that may control their response at a site in Central Michigan. In situ and 2D surface resistivity, ground penetrating radar (GPR), and electromagnetic methods (EM) constrained by soil boring data were used to investigate the electrical properties of a light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) contaminant plume that resulted from 50 years of leakage into a glacio-fluvial geologic setting. Overall, the electrical signature from the in situ resistivity measurements were best able to image the subsurface stratigraphy and the associated contamination zone. GPR also mapped the subsurface stratigraphy. In particular, the GPR recorded a reflector that is subparallel to the water table, and occurs a few meters above the current free product level, which is coincident with the top of an oil-stained, light-gray sand layer. Further, regions of attenuated GPR reflections (shadow zones) due to enhanced conductivities were found to be coincident with low apparent resistivities. 2D geoelectrical measurements successfully imaged the top of the saturated zone and the underlying clay layer, but was unable to resolve any anomalous region that could be attributed to the hydrocarbon contamination. Likewise, the EM results provided no evidence of the presence of the free product plume at depth. Throughout this investigation, geoelectric measurements consistently recorded low resistivities (high apparent conductivities) associated with zones containing the free/residual product plume instead of high resistivities as has been suggested by the simple intuitive model. From this, it is inferred that substantial modification of the geochemical characteristics of the plume, surrounding media, and associated groundwater has occurred as a result of biogeochemical reactions. It is evident from this study that in situ resistivity measurements combined with surface geoelectrical measurements can characterize the distribution of conductive zones that may be associated with the biodegradation of LNAPL in the subsurface. Thus, the application of these techniques to hydrogeologic, contaminant monitoring, and remediation studies are far reaching. (c) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In a sedimentary environment, layered models are often capable of representing the actual geology more accurately than smooth minimum structure models. Further- more, interval thicknesses and resistivities are often the parameters to which non- geophysicist experts can relate and base decisions on when using them in waste site remediation, groundwater modelling and physical planning. We present a laterally constrained inversion scheme for continuous resistivity data based on a layered earth model (1D). All 1D data sets and models are inverted as one system, producing layered sections with lateral smooth transitions. The mod- els are regularized through laterally equal constraints that tie interface depths and resistivities of adjacent layers. Prior information, e.g. originating from electric logs, migrates through the lateral constraints to the adjacent models, making resolution of equivalences possible to some extent. Information from areas with well-resolved parameters will migrate through the constraints in a similar way to help resolve the poorly constrained parameters. The estimated model is complemented by a full sen- sitivity analysis of the model parameters, supporting quantitative evaluation of the inversion result. Examples from synthetic 2D models show that the model recognition of a sublay- ered 2D wedge model is improved using the laterally constrained inversion approach when compared with a section of combined1Dmodels and when compared with a 2D minimum structure inversion. Case histories with data from two different continuous DC systems support the conclusions drawn from the synthetic example. INTRODUCTION Electrical methods have been used successfully for a long time in environmental and hydrogeophysical studies (Fitterman 1987; Dodds and Ivic 1990; Sandberg and Hall 1990; Taylor, Widmer and Chesley 1992; Robineau et al. 1997; Albouy et al. 2001). Nowadays, standard methods allow a more detailed mapping by continuously gathering profile orientated data using either multiple electrode systems, such as the continu- ous vertical electrical sounding (CVES) system (Dahlin 1996; Bernstone and Dahlin 1999) or systems like the pulled ar- ∗E-mail: esben.auken@geo.au.dk ray continuous electrical sounding (PACES) system},

Accordingly there is an increased need for reviewing the recent, and not so recent, achievements in the field. In the first part of this review paper I consider the finite-difference, finite-element and integral equation approaches that are presently applied for the rigorous numerical solution of fully 3-D EM forward problems. I mention the merits and drawbacks of these approaches, and focus on the most essential aspects of numerical implementations, such as preconditioning and solving the resulting systems of linear equations. I refer to some of the most advanced, state-of-the-art, solvers that are today available for such important geophysical applications as induction logging, airborne and controlled-source EM, magnetotellurics, and global induction studies. Then, in the second part of the paper, I review some of the methods that are commonly used to solve 3-D EM inverse problems and analyse current implementations of the methods available. In particular, I also address the important aspects of nonlinear Newton-type optimisation techniques and computation of gradients and sensitivities associated with these problems.},

abstract = {The limited-memory quasi-Newton optimization method with simple bounds has been applied to develop a novel fully three-dimensional (3-D) magnetotelluric (MT) inversion technique. This nonlinear inversion is based on iterative minimization of a classical Tikhonov-type regularized penalty functional. But instead of the usual model space of log resistivities, the approach iterates in a model space with simple bounds imposed on the conductivities of the 3-D target. The method requires storage that is proportional to n(cp) x N, where the N is the number of conductivities to be recovered and ncp is the number of the correction pairs ( practically, only a few). This is much less than requirements imposed by other Newton type methods ( that usually require storage proportional to N x M, or N x N, where M is the number of data to be inverted). Using an adjoint method to calculate the gradients of the misfit drastically accelerates the inversion. The inversion also involves all four entries of the MT impedance matrix. The integral equation forward modelling code x3d by Avdeev et al. [ 1, 2] is employed as an engine for this inversion. Convergence, performance and accuracy of the inversion are demonstrated on a 3D MT synthetic, but realistic, example.},

abstract = {We propose a three-dimensional (3-D) inversion scheme for deep ocean magnetotelluric (MT) data that enables us to incorporate both the local small-scale topography effect and regional large-scale topography effect, whose length scale is comparable with that of the mantle structure to be resolved by the inversion. We assume that the MT impedance tensor Z is approximately equal to the MT response of the total structure Zts, expressed by the product of the local topographic distortion term Dlt and the response to the regional structure Zrs that consists of the regional topography over the mantle electrical conductivity structure Z ≈ Zts = DltZrs. We also assume that Dlt may be treated as a site correction term, which is not dependent on the conductivity structure to be solved in the inversion. Dlt is calculated before the inversion iteration is carried out through the forward modelling of Zts and Zrs using a good initial guess for the mantle structure. However, the initial Zts is separately modelled by another forward modelling program, which is more efficient in terms of computation cost. The model space of the inversion includes only the regional structure so that the modelled response is Zrs. Thus, in the inversion, Zts is calculated from Zrs andDlt; Zrs is modelled at every iteration butDlt is fixed throughout the inversion. The sensitivity of Zts to the conductivity is calculated considering Dlt as a constant. This scheme requires modelling only of the regional scale structure in the inversion process, saving computational resources and time, which is critical in the 3-D case. Tests using a synthetic model and data demonstrate that incorporating the local topography effect in this scheme was successful and produced an accurate reconstruction of the given mantle structure. © The Authors 2013.

abstract = {Geothermal energy is the energy contained as heat in the Earth’s interior. This overview describes the internal structure of the Earth together with the heat transfer mechanisms inside mantle and crust. It also shows the location of geothermal fields on specific areas of the Earth. The Earth’s heat flow and geothermal gradient are defined, as well as the types of geothermal fields, the geologic environment of geothermal energy, and the methods of exploration for geothermal resources including drilling and resource assessment. Geothermal energy, as natural steam and hot water, has been exploited for decades to generate electricity, and both in space heating and industrial processes. The geothermal electrical installed capacity in the world is 7974 MWe (year 2000), and the electrical energy generated is 49.3 billion kWh/year, representing 0.3 \% of the world total electrical energy which was 15,342 billion kWh in 2000. In developing countries, where total installed electrical power is still low, geothermal energy can play a significant role: in the Philippines 21\% of electricity comes from geothermal steam, 20\% in El Salvador, 17\% in Nicaragua, 10\% in Costa Rica and 8\% in Kenya. Electricity is produced with an efficiency of 10–17\%. The geothermal kWh is generally cost-competitive with conventional sources of energy, in the range 2–10 UScents/kWh, and the geothermal electrical capacity installed in the world (1998) was 1/5 of that from biomass, but comparable with that from wind sources. The thermal capacity in non-electrical uses (greenhouses, aquaculture, district heating, industrial processes) is 15,14 MWt (year 2000). Financial investments in geothermal electrical and non-electrical uses world-wide in the period 1973–1992 were estimated at about US\$22,000 million. Present technology makes it possible to control the environmental impact of geothermal exploitation, and an effective and easily implemented policy to encourage geothermal energy development, and the abatement of carbon dioxide emissions would take advantage from the imposition of a carbon tax. The future use of geothermal energy from advanced technologies such as the exploitation of hot dry rock/hot wet rock systems, magma bodies and geopressured reservoirs, is briefly discussed. While the viability of hot dry rock technology has been proven, research and development are still necessary for the other two sources. A brief discussion on training of specialists, geothermal literature, on-line information, and geothermal associations concludes the review.},

abstract = {Geothermal energy is the energy contained as heat in the Earth’s interior. This overview describes the internal structure of the Earth together with the heat transfer mechanisms inside mantle and crust. It also shows the location of geothermal fields on specific areas of the Earth. The Earth’s heat flow and geothermal gradient are defined, as well as the types of geothermal fields, the geologic environment of geothermal energy, and the methods of exploration for geothermal resources including drilling and resource assessment. Geothermal energy, as natural steam and hot water, has been exploited for decades to generate electricity, and both in space heating and industrial processes. The geothermal electrical installed capacity in the world is 7974 MWe (year 2000), and the electrical energy generated is 49.3 billion kWh/year, representing 0.3 \% of the world total electrical energy which was 15,342 billion kWh in 2000. In developing countries, where total installed electrical power is still low, geothermal energy can play a significant role: in the Philippines 21\% of electricity comes from geothermal steam, 20\% in El Salvador, 17\% in Nicaragua, 10\% in Costa Rica and 8\% in Kenya. Electricity is produced with an efficiency of 10–17\%. The geothermal kWh is generally cost-competitive with conventional sources of energy, in the range 2–10 UScents/kWh, and the geothermal electrical capacity installed in the world (1998) was 1/5 of that from biomass, but comparable with that from wind sources. The thermal capacity in non-electrical uses (greenhouses, aquaculture, district heating, industrial processes) is 15,14 MWt (year 2000). Financial investments in geothermal electrical and non-electrical uses world-wide in the period 1973–1992 were estimated at about US\$22,000 million. Present technology makes it possible to control the environmental impact of geothermal exploitation, and an effective and easily implemented policy to encourage geothermal energy development, and the abatement of carbon dioxide emissions would take advantage from the imposition of a carbon tax. The future use of geothermal energy from advanced technologies such as the exploitation of hot dry rock/hot wet rock systems, magma bodies and geopressured reservoirs, is briefly discussed. While the viability of hot dry rock technology has been proven, research and development are still necessary for the other two sources. A brief discussion on training of specialists, geothermal literature, on-line information, and geothermal associations concludes the review.},

abstract = {The ability of the VLF-R (Resistivity) method to provide quantitative subsurface resistivity information is examined. The frequencies used in conventional VLF (15 to 30 kHz) provide the deepest penetrations of the multi-frequency, extended method of RadioMT. Both methods are considered. VLF data, being effectively single frequency, are insufficient to resolve one-dimensional (1D) (vertical) structure in any detail. At the site investigation scale, however, it is the departures from the background (vertically uniform) structure that are of interest. Improved methodologies for the quantitative assessment of VLF data derive from advances in regularised inversion techniques. Hydrogeological and waste-site examples of VLF-R survey data, aided by wide-band (VLF/RadioMT) synthetic modelling and inversion studies, are used to illustrate their shallow (0 to 20 m) resolution capabilities in conductive environments.

abstract = {Geophysical investigations using 2-D DC resistivity were carried out on old parts of two sim- ilar landfills, with waste of different ages. The data sets, which included high data density in both ver- tical and horizontal directions, were interpreted with 2-D smoothness constrained inversion. The landfills were excavated after the surveying. The objective was to test the capability of the resistivity method as a pre-characterization technique. The objectives were only partially fulfilled. First, the moisture content was the parameter that appeared to exert the dominant control over the resistivity distribution of the landfill. The most important po- tential information that can be recovered is, there- fore, an indication of the waste piles hydraulics. Second, it was neither possible to estimate the amount of recoverable soils, nor to correlate the type of waste with the resistivity models. However, discrete anomalies were identified, and if specific materials are searched for, the resistivity models in- dicate possible places to search.},

abstract = {Closely-spaced broadband MT (magnetotelluric) data measured on a profile through the Ohaaki geothermal system show that the basement greywacke directly beneath the geothermal field is resistive. There is no evidence in these MT data for the existence of an intrusive heat source directly beneath Ohaaki. However, these data confirm that a dipping conductive zone links the near surface low resistivity anomaly associated with the geothermal field to a deep region of low resistivity that is offset to the northwest. The resistivity of the dipping conductor is consistent with a zone of fracturing within the basement meta-sediments, and is interpreted to show the location of upwelling high-temperature fluids that supply the Ohaaki geothermal field from a deep magmatic source.},

abstract = {Kanchanaburi province, western Thailand, is in the middle of Shan–Thai terrane. Paleomagnetic and geological data support the hypothesis of dual subduction zones beneath the Shan–Thai terrane. During the late Triassic there was a westward subduction in the east where the Lampang-Chiang Rai block subducted beneath the Shan–Thai terrane. In addition, in the early Tertiary, the western Burma terrane subducted underneath the Shan–Thai in the west resulting in an eastward subduction. A pioneer survey of this region was therefore conducted using magnetotelluric (MT) techniques with the aim of finding deep structures associated with these ancient subduction zones. 39 MT stations were deployed to cover most of the province. Resistivity structures are obtained from the 3-D inversion. The near surface resistivity structures correspond well with the surface geology. The mid and lower crusts are conductive and this is interpreted as the crusts being composed of mafic granulites of 3\% porosity in which the remnant dehydrated fluid was accumulated during the subduction. In addition, the westward and eastward subduction zones generated mafic/ultramafic intrusions which appear as two conductive zones on the east and west, respectively. These two conductors and the conductive lower crust support the hypotheses of the middle Triassic to Miocene dual subduction zones.},

abstract = {A data space Occam's inversion algorithm for 2D DC resistivity data has been developed to seek the smoothest structure subject to an appropriate fit to the data. For traditional model space Gauss-Newton (GN) type inversion, the system of equations has the dimensions of M × M, where M is the number of model parameter, resulting in extensive computing time and memory storage. However, the system of equations can be mathematically transformed to the data space, resulting in a dramatic drop in its dimensions to N × N, where N is the number of data parameter, which is usually less than M. The transformation has helped to significantly reduce both computing time and memory storage. Numerical experiments with synthetic data and field data show that applying the data space technique to 2D DC resistivity data for various configurations is robust and accurate when compared with the results from the model space method and the commercial software RES2DINV. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Conceptual geological models based on geophysical data can elucidate aquifer architecture and heterogeneity at meter and smaller scales, which can lead to better predictions of preferential flow pathways. The macrodispersion experiment (MADE) site, with >2000 measurements of hydraulic conductivity obtained and three tracer tests conducted, serves as an ideal natural laboratory for examining relationships between subsurface flow characteristics and geophysical attributes in fluvial aquifers. The spatial variation of hydraulic conductivity measurements indicates a large degree of site heterogeneity. To evaluate the usefulness of geophysical methods for better delineating fluvial aquifer heterogeneities and distribution of preferential flow paths, a surface grid of two-dimensional ground penetrating radar (GPR) and direct current (DC) resistivity data were collected. A geological model was developed from these data that delineate four stratigraphic units with distinct electrical and radar properties including (from top to bottom) (1) a meandering fluvial system (MFS); (2) a braided fluvial system (BFS); (3) fine-grained sands; and (4) a clay-rich interval. A paleochannel, inferred by other authors to affect flow, was mapped in the MFS with both DC resistivity and GPR data. The channel is 2 to 4 m deep and, based on resistivity values, is predominantly filled with clay and silt. Comparing previously collected hydraulic conductivity measurements and tracer-plume migration patterns to the geological model indicates that flow primarily occurs in the BFS and that the channel mapped in the MFS has no influence on plume migration patterns.},

abstract = {Geothermal energy is the heat energy contained within Earth’s body. This heat sometimes creates underground reservoirs of hot water. Drilling into these will release high-pressure steam and water that can be used in a steam turbine to produce electric power. Such reservoirs are normally found along tectonic plate boundaries. Elsewhere there are regions of hot rock close to Earth’s surface that can be exploited by drilling and then pumping high-pressure water into the rock where is heated and then extracted. The temperature of water in geothermal reservoirs is relatively low and the efficiency of energy extraction is low too. Energy extraction is usually by steam turbine. This can be driven directly if the reservoir provides steam, but if the energy source is hot water then a flash steam plant is normally used. For very low-temperature reservoirs a binary cycle turbine system is preferred.},

Work included seismic and magnetotelluric surveys carried out close to well Kompina-2 to create a detailed structural-geologic model and characterize the anisotropic fracture system around the borehole. The study included the reprocessing of archival data from selected boreholes and 2D seismic lines. The collected data were used to identify formations with high fracture permeability and the presumed flow path of geothermal (∼110 °C) brine in high productivity zones, and determining rock porosities and salinity distribution in the subsurface. The next stage of the investigations will focus on siting a second borehole and studying the possibility of installing a plant for electrical generation or direct geothermal heat applications. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A detailed survey with magnetotelluric measurements covering the period range 0.04-500 s was carried out to define the geoelectrical structure of G\"{o}yn\"{u}k geothermal area, northwest Anatolia. The study area is not far from the well-known geothermal field around northwest Anatolia that has several potentially valuable minerals and hot springs. The resulting two-dimensional (2-D) geoelectric structures, with true resistivity values, obtained from transverse electric (TE), transverse magnetic (TM) and joint TE-TM data inversion were interpreted by considering geological cross-sections, gravity anomaly and direct current (dc) Schlumberger vertical electrical sounding (VES) data. The 2-D models of geoelectric structures obtained from these inversions clearly display the existence of three electrically conductive (∼4-6 $\Omega$ m) zones Z1, Z2 and sZ. The origin of remarkably good conductivity within the two large zones Z1 and Z2 located from the depth of about 5 km to depths of more than 15 km, and the existence of a smaller zone sZ at between 4-7 km are explained by the circulation of hydrothermal fluids with low resistivity values (0.28-0.52 $\Omega$ m) and by the effects of a strong hydrothermal alteration in the rocks. A low magnetic anomaly with low intensity of about ≤50 $\gamma$ under the middle of the G\"{o}yn\"{u}k area is ascribed to the hydrothermal demagnetisation of the rocks due to geothermal activity. The sharp decrease in resistivity to very low values probably suggests that both zones Z1 and Z2 are highly permeable (porosity about 30\%) and therefore saturated with underground geothermal fluids. The upper zone sZ may act as a corridor for hydrothermal circulation between both of the zones Z1 and Z2, and it is a prime target for further geothermal exploration. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This method is applied to both synthetic and field data to investigate the com- bined use of seismicAVAandCSEMdata for gas saturation esti- mation. Results show that the method is effective for joint inver- sion; the incorporation ofCSEMdata reduces uncertainty in fluid saturation estimation compared to inversion of seismic AVA data alone. The improvement in gas saturation estimation ob- tained from joint inversion for field data is less significant than for synthetic data because of the large number of unknown noise sources inherent in the field data.},

abstract = {Surface electrical and electromagnetic methods have a limited resolution capability for determining the conductivity structure of the earth. In one-dimensional modelling a collection of many thin layers is frequently considered as one composite layer, which is then macro-anisotropic. Neither galvanic methods nor inductive methods alone can resolve the anisotropy of the ground, but a joint inversion of galvanic and inductive data may do so. The necessity of including the coefficient of anisotropy in the joint inversion of galvanic and inductive sounding data is demonstrated. An analysis is made of the combined use of geoelectrical and transient soundings to resolve the coefficient of anisotropy of a subsurface layer for varying thickness, resistivity and coefficient of anisotropy. It is found that the coefficient of anisotropy is well resolved only for layers that are many times thicker than the overburden and for coefficients of anisotropy that are not too small. The ability of the joint inversion of geoelectrical and transient sounding data to resolve macro-anisotropic layers is tested using realistic earth models determined from electrical logs.},

abstract = {The conductive and capacitive material properties of the subsurface can be quantified through the frequency-dependent complex resistivity. However, the routine three-dimensional (3D) interpretation of voluminous induced polarization (IP) data sets still poses a challenge due to large computational demands and solution nonuniqueness. We have developed a flexible methodology for 3D (spectral) IP data inversion. Our inversion algorithm is adapted from a frequency-domain electromagnetic (EM) inversion method primarily developed for large-scale hydrocarbon and geothermal energy exploration purposes. The method has proven to be efficient by implementing the nonlinear conjugate gradient method with hierarchical parallelism and by using an optimal finite-difference forward modeling mesh design scheme. The method allows for a large range of survey scales, providing a tool for both exploration and environmental applications. We experimented with an image focusing technique to improve the poor depth resolution of surface data sets with small survey spreads. The algorithms underlying forward modeling operator properly accounts for EM coupling effects; thus, traditionally used EM coupling correction procedures are not needed. The methodology was applied to both synthetic and field data. We tested the benefit of directly inverting EM coupling contaminated data using a synthetic largescale exploration data set. Afterward, we further tested the monitoring capability of our method by inverting time-lapse data from an environmental remediation experiment near Rifle, Colorado. Similar trends observed in both our solution and another 2D inversion were in accordance with previous findings about the IP effects due to subsurface microbial activity.},

abstract = {The inversion of electromagnetic sounding data does not yield a unique solution, but inevitably a single model to interpret the observations is sought. We re- commend that this model be as simple, or smooth, as possible, in order to reduce the temptation to overinter- pret the data and to eliminate arbitrary discontinuities in simple layered models. To obtain smooth models, the nonlinear forward problem is linearized about a starting model in the usual way, but it is then solved explicitly for the desired model rather than for a model correction. By parame- terizing the model in terms of its first or second deriva- tive with depth, the minimum norm solution yields the smoothest possible model. Rather than fitting the experimental data as well as possible (which maximizes the roughness of the model), the smoothest model which fits the data to within an expected tolerance is sought. A practical scheme is de- veloped which optimizes the step size at each iteration and retains the computational efficiency of layered models, resulting in a stable and rapidly convergent al- gorithm. The inversion of both magnetotelluric and Schlumberger sounding field data, and a joint magnetotelluric-resistivity inversion, demonstrate the method and show it to have practical application.

abstract = {A magnetotelluric (MT) survey was conducted on the Caldas Novas geothermal reservoir located in the state og Goi\'{a}s, Central Brazil. The region of Caldas Novas is a popular tourist spot because of the occurence of hot water springs. The purpose of the first MT survey in this area is to provide more information on the geoelectrical structure of this important geothermal reservoir. The MT method is a frequency domain technique that utilizes naturally occuring magnetic and electric signals as source to obtain a resistivity map of the subsurface. Since temperature and permeability are some of the factors controlling electrical resistivity, MT is widely utilized for surveying geothermal areas such as Caldas Novas. Data were acquired along two profiles crossing the Serra de Caldas (Caldas Mountains) with a total of 25 MT stations. Frequencies of acquisition were in the range from 0.008 to 176 Hz. Spacing between stations were usually around 5 km. Apparent resistivity and phase data from the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes were computed for both profiles. Very high (100,000 $\Omega$ m) apparent resistivity values in the TM mode indicate distortion, possibly caused by 3-D resistive structures. In this work, we focus on Profile 2, which was acquired aligned at N40°E, approximately following the direction of weakness N50°E. Two-dimensional (2-D) inversion suggests a basin-like model with very high-resistivity block structures associated with concentric faulting below the Caldas Mountains inside a resistive basin that extends to depths of approximately 25-30 km. This model is in good agreement with gravity data and the available geological information in the area and can help delineate areas of new geothermal reservoirs. The high resistivity associated with depression in th MT model can be interpreted as caused by the low-permeability quartzites that form the Caldas Mountains. Although the survey configuration does not allow for a full three-dimensional (3-D) interpretation, a 3-D resistivity model was constructed and the MT responses computed. The 3-D synthetic data explains the behavior of both the TE and TM modes in this faulted resistive environment. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Magnetotelluric (MT) data are inverted for smooth 2-D models using an extension of the existing I-D algorithm, Occams inversion. Since an MT data set consists of a finite number of imprecise data, an infinity of solutions to the inverse problem exists. Fitting field or synthetic electromagnetic data as closely as possible results in theoretical models with a maximum amount of roughness, or structure. How- ever, by relaxing the misfit criterion only a small amount, models which are maximally smooth may be generated. Smooth models are less likely to result in overinterpretation of the data and reflect the true resolving power of the MT method. The models are composed of a large number of rectangular prisms, each having a constant conductivity. A priori informa- tion, in the form of boundary locations only or both boundary locations and conductivity, may be in- cluded, providing a powerful tool for improving the resolving power of the data. Joint inversion of TE and TM synthetic data generated from known models allows comparison of smooth models with the true structure. In most cases, smoothed versions of the true structure may be recovered in 12-16 iterations. However, resistive features with a size comparable to depth of burial are poorly resolved. Real MT data present problems of non-Gaussian data errors, the breakdown of the two-dimensionality assumption and the large number of data in broadband soundings: nevertheless, real data can be inverted using the algorithm.},

abstract = {A Time Domain Electromagnetic (TDEM) survey was carried out in and around the caldera of the Fogo volcano, Cape Verde Islands, to detect the low resistive structures that could be related to groundwater. A sign reversal in the sounding curves was encountered in central-loop measurements for the soundings located in the centre of the caldera along three main radial profiles. The negative transients are recorded in the early channels between 6.8 and 37 $\mu$s. Negative values in an early time transient is an unusual field observation, and consequently the first step was to check the data to ascertain their accuracy and quality. In the second step, three-dimensional (3D) effects are evaluated and ruled out in this zone, while an Induced Polarization (IP) phenomenon is observed using Direct Current (DC) sounding measurements. In the third step, the IP effect is called upon to explain the TDEM distortions; a Cole-Cole dispersive conductivity is found to be adequate to fit the field data. However, the more relevant one-dimensional (1D) model is recovered when both central-loop and offset-loop data are jointly taken into account, thus indicating that an effect of dispersive conductivity is necessary to explain the field data. The 1D electrical structure exhibits four layers, with decreasing resistivity with depth. Only the first layer is polarizable and its Cole-Cole parameters are m = 0.85, c = 0.8 and $\tau$ = 0.02 ms for chargeability, frequency dependence and time constant, respectively. However, the Cole-Cole parameters deduced from TDEM forward modelling remain different from those deduced from DC/IP sounding. In this volcanic setting, this IP effect may be caused by the presence of small grains of magnetite and/or by the granularity of effusive products (lapillis). As a conclusion, it is shown that a modelling using different TDEM data sets is essential to recover the electrical structure of this area. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = { It is widely believed that the Tikhonov-Cagniard model can be applied in the magnetotelluric method of exploration geophysics if the horizontal field changes are sufficiently slow. Actually, this is overly restrictive and may give rise to unjustified doubts about the validity of the Tikhonov-Cagniard model. This paper shows that the condition determining the applicability of the model is the linearity of the horizontal field changes, rather than the slowness of these changes. This considerably extends the sphere of practical applications of the Tikhonov-Cagniard model.},

@book{Edenhofer2012,
abstract = {Climate change is one of the great challenges of the 21st century. Its most severe impacts may still be avoided if efforts are made to transform current energy systems. Renewable energy sources have a large potential to displace emissions of greenhouse gases from the combustion of fossil fuels and thereby to mitigate climate change. If implemented properly, renewable energy sources can contribute to social and economic development, to energy access, to a secure and sustainable energy supply, and to a reduction of negative impacts of energy provision on the environment and human health. This Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) impartially assesses the scientifi c literature on the potential role of renewable energy in the mitigation of climate change for policymakers, the private sector, academic researchers and civil society. It covers six renewable energy sources – bioenergy, direct solar energy, geothermal energy, hydropower, ocean energy and wind energy – as well as their integration into present and future energy systems. It considers the environmental and social consequences associated with the deployment of these technologies, and presents strategies to overcome technical as well as non-technical obstacles to their application and diffusion. The authors also compare the levelized cost of energy from renewable energy sources to recent non-renewable energy costs. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to provide the world with a clear scientifi c view on the current state of knowledge on climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts.},

@article{Effersø1999,
abstract = {It is shown that the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum is characterized by strong amplitude-modulated transmitters operating in the target bandwidth of transient electromagnetic (TEM) measurements. As these transmitters cause significant noise in TEM soundings, it is mandatory to band-limit the input signals to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and thereby the depth of exploration. Band-limitation will distort the TEM responses, which leads to erroneous inversion results if the applied low-pass filters are not accounted for in the inversion scheme. We incorporate the low-pass filters in the inversion scheme and test the inversion approach on theoretical and field data. Inversion of band-limited theoretical responses results in recovery of erroneous resistivity models if the filters are not included in the inversion scheme. By contrast, inversion of band-limited theoretical and field data, for which the applied low-pass filters are included in the inversion scheme, leads to recovery of similar resistivity models, independent of the applied cut-off frequencies.},

abstract = {We show, through an examination of residuals, that all of the statistical assumptions usually used in estimating transfer functions for geomagnetic induction data fail at periods from 5 min to several hours at geomagnetic mid-latitudes. This failure can be traced to the finite spatial scale of many sources. In the past, workers have tried to deal with this problem by hand selecting data segments thought to be free of source effects. We propose an automatic robust analysis scheme which accounts for the systematic increase of errors with increasing power and which automatically downweights source contaminated outliers. We demonstrate that, in contrast to ordinary least squares, this automatic procedure consistently yields reliable transfer function estimates with realistic errors.},

@article{Esparza1997,
abstract = {An automatic inverse method has been developed for generating layered earth models from electrical sound- ing data. The models have the minimum number of lay- ers required to fit a resistivity sounding curve or a com- bined resistivity and induced polarization sounding. The ground is modeled using a very large number of thin layers to accommodate arbitrary variations. The prop- erties of the layers are optimized using as a constraint the L1 norm of the vertical derivative of the resistiv- ity distribution. The use of linear programming leads to piecewise smooth distributions that simulate traditional models made up of a few uniform layers. The process considers from the simplest model of a uniform half- space to models of many layers, without fixing a priori the number of discontinuities. The solution is sought by iterating a new linear approximation, similar to the classical process of linearization, except that a refer- ence model is not present in either the data vector or the unknown function. For induced polarization sound- ings, the problem is linear and the solution is obtained in a single iteration, provided an adequate resistivity model is available. The performance of the method is illustrated using numerical experiments and published deep resistivity data from Australia. The method also is applied to combined resistivity and induced polar- ization soundings from a local groundwater prospect in Mexico},

abstract = {Urban and suburban areas of large cities impose great challenges to geophysical surveys because of high-level ambient noise. This is particularly true for controlled source audio-frequency magnetotellurics (CSAMT) because the frequency range of the method overlaps those of many civil and industrial noises. Among the different types of noise sources, perhaps the most noticeable one is the 50-Hz power grid. We have successfully applied the CSAMT method for groundwater exploration in a suburban Beijing area where the ambient noise level is about three times as high as would normally be encountered. Several steps were taken in assuring quality use of the method, including careful survey design, adequate frequency range selection, and large transmitter dipole length and transmitter-receiver spacing. The next step was static effect removal through low-pass filtering and topography correction to remove any nonhorizontal component in the electric field measurement. Finally, a 1D inversion method was applied to construct an (apparent) resistivity cross section. The survey revealed a low-resistivity, water-bearing layer sandwiched between a surface cover layer and the bedrock. The available well data suggested that the depth of the bedrock was accurately mapped, to within about 2 m, at a depth level of 150–165 m.},

abstract = {We investigated the crustal structure of the Kii peninsula, in the southwestern Japan forearc, using the magnetotelluric (MT) method. We found two upper-crustal anomalies: (1) a sub-horizontal conductive layer dipping northwest, at depths of 5–10 km beneath the Cretaceous accreted terrane; (2) a resistive block at depths of 2–15 km beneath the Tertiary accreted terrane. The former is interpreted as a flysh unit. The latter is consistent with the high-velocity structure detected by refraction experiments and may be a lost continental fragment of the Kuroshio paleoland. Such a continental fragment has been predicted by sedimentological studies, but there had been no geophysical supporting evidence. The mid-crustal seismicity clusters near the bottom of the resistive body. This suggests that the lost paleoland is beneath the current forearc. We also found a conductive layer in the deep crust, consistent with seismic reflectors at 15–25 km depth. This implies trapped free water reflecting a geotherm of 400°C.},

@article{Fumero2000,
abstract = {Despite nonmonotonic properties, weak convergence performance and possible erratic behavior, the standard subgradient optimization method is still one of the most widely adopted algorithm for solving the Lagrangean dual problem in practical applications. Several attempts have been made recently to improve the algorithm performance. In this paper we present a modified algorithm which employs a variable target value for the step length determination and considers a direction given by a conic combination of possibly all previously generated subgradients. Computational experience of the proposed algorithm on Traveling Salesman and Assignment problems of different sizes is reported. Scope and purpose In this paper, the problem of maximizing a concave and continuous function which is not differentiable everywhere is studied. Such a problem is quite common in the field of mathematical programming: For instance, whenever considering the Lagrangean relaxation of a linear programming problem, in order to solve the Lagrangean dual problem, one should optimize a dual objective function which is not differentiable everywhere. One of the most widely adopted solution method for solving the dual problem is subgradient optimization. Although many other procedures, with stronger convergence properties, have been developed (among the others, bundle methods or the Short space dilation method), yet, subgradient optimization seems to have wide acceptability among researchers and remains as one of the most effective and useful technique for solving dual problems, especially for large problems with complex structures. In an attempt to improve the performance of the subgradient algorithm, researchers have tried to develop modifications and extensions of the basic scheme, aimed to reduce its main weaknesses (nonmonotonicity, weak convergence properties and lack of a definite termination criteria). In this paper, in order to further improve the computational efficiency of the procedure, we propose a modified subgradient algorithm which unifies some of the most promising results in the field of subgradient optimization. The provided solution scheme is applied to classical problems of the Operations Research area (Assignment and Traveling Salesman): the computational results obtained show a relevant improvement over similar algorithm previously proposed.

abstract = {We propose to deepen the interpretation of combined geophysical methods (georadar, seismic and electric) to assess physical properties characterizing the near-surface porous formations, especially the influence of water. Velocity analysis of multioffset georadar data are used together with seismic methods to estimate lateral and vertical ground water fluctuations. This enables us to identify transitions from non-saturated to fully saturated porous layers with certainty. Furthermore, the accurate knowledge of seismic velocities helps to estimate the porosity of the ground water formations. Finally, we show how the radar technique may be useful in solving the problem of trade-off between bulk resistivity, which is deduced from electrical measurements, and that of water ionic conductivity and water content. These theoretical considerations are illustrated using various measurements conducted at the same test site. Our interpretation is compared with a few laboratory measurements on water and soil samples. This study displays the impact of combined geophysical approaches for providing models of water and ionic transfers down to a depth of several metres. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Distant lightning activity, the natural energy source for the audio-magnetotelluric (AMT)method, has a sig- nal minimum between 1 and 5 kHz, the so-called AMT dead band. The energy in this band exhibits both di- urnal and annual variation; magnetic-field amplitudes during the daytime are often well below the noise lev- els of existing sensors (coil magnetometers), thus re- ducing the effectiveness of the method for quantita- tive high-resolution studies of near-surface targets. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a hybrid acquisi- tion and processing methodology based on combining the telluric-telluric (T-T) and telluric-magnetotelluric (T-MT) methods in this frequency range. Our method records the telluric channels at several sites and at base and remote reference stations during the day and records the full magnetotelluric (MT) components at the base and remote stations only during the night. Applying a tensor multiplicative relationship between these responses, we obtain the T-MT AMT transfer functions for the sites; these transfer functions can rep- resent a reasonable approximation of the real AMT impedance tensors. To test the approach, a T-MT ex- periment was carried out in Sudbury, northern Ontario, during summer 2000. We compare the processed day- time data using the conventionalMT approach to those obtained from our T-MT approach. The results demon- strate that our method can determine high-quality esti- mates in the dead band, although the estimates can be severely affected by noise.},

abstract = {Since the true Earth is 3-D in nature, a three-dimensional (3-D) inversion has clear advantages over lower dimensional inversions. We utilized a 3-D magnetotelluric (MT) inversion code, WSINV3DMT, to obtain a realistic resistivity model using a long period MT data set collected in the Northwest Sabalan geothermal field in Ardabil, Iran. The apparent resistivity and phase curves, the magnetic induction vectors, the impedance polar diagrams and the rotational invariant of impedance tensor, indicate a complex 3-D conductivity structure. After setting up the model parameters and designing the appropriate block discretization, we performed the 3-D inversions for two sets of observed data; one set includes the full MT impedance tensor and another set contains only off-diagonal elements of the MT impedance. The final model was selected according to the relative magnitude of the data misfit and the model norm with respect to various Lagrangian multipliers. The results of this study illustrate the 3-D inversion of the off-diagonal elements of MT impedance tensor is precisely enough to explain the structures related to the geothermal source. The obtained results were compared with the results of available 2-D models and they are then interpreted using all of the geological and drilling data of the area. The main outcome of this study is the precise delineation of the geometry of geothermal source that is located at the center of the study area with a surface coverage of about 7km2.},

abstract = {Geological and geophysical data gathered in the geothermal areas of southern Tuscany, located in the inner part of the northern Apennines, indicate the presence of granite intrusions. The most relevant data are: (1) regional asthenospheric ascent to a depth of 40–50 km; (2) granitic dykes as old as 3.8-2.9 Ma and a widespread contact aureole found in several deep geothermal wells; (3) very high heat flow values, interpreted as the result of convective circulation of hot fluids above shallow magmatic bodies; (4) the presence of low-density bodies inferred from low gravity values, often correlated with positive heat flow anomalies; (5) the occurrence of a highly reflective horizon (named K) in a depth range of 3–12 km in the geothermal areas as shown by seismic reflection data; (6) a 30–40 km wide low-velocity body, below the K horizon, whose existence is supported by local earthquake tomography and teleseismic studies; (7) the presence of a conductive body which correlates well with the anomalous tomographic and teleseismic body, as revealed by magnetotelluric surveys. The goal of the paper is to test different alternative crustal models by using these data. The models are (1) granite intrusion, (2) geopressurized fluids below impervious layers, (3) contact metamorphic aureole, (4) mylonite layers at the upper/lower crust transition, and (5) some combination of the four. The occurrence of shallow intrusive bodies, still partially molten and associated with saline brines is considered the most tenable model.},

abstract = {An outcropping hemispherical inhomogeneity em- bedded in a two-dimensional (2-D) earth is used to model the effects of three-dimensional (3-D) near- surface electromagnetic (EM) “static” distortion. An- alytical solutions are first derived for the galvanic electric and magnetic scattering operators of the het- erogeneity. To represent the local distortion by 3-D structures of fields which were produced by a large- scale Z-D structure, these 3-D scattering operators are applied to 2-D electric and magnetic fields derived by numerical modeling to synthesize an MT data set. Synthetic noise is also included in the data. These synthetic data are used to study the parame- ters recovered by several published methods for de- composing or parameterizing the measured MT imped- ance tensor. The stability of these parameters in the presence of noise is also examined. The parameteriza- tions studied include the conventional 2-D parameter- ization (Swift, 1967), Eggers’s (1982) and Spitz’s (1985) eigenstate formulations, LaTorraca et al.‘s (1986) SVD decomposition, and the Groom and Bailey (1989) method designed specifically for 3-D galvanic electric scattering. The relationships between the im- pedance or eigenvalue estimates of each method and the true regional impedances are examined, as are the azimuthal (e.g., regional 2-D strike, eigenvector orien- tation and local strike) and ellipticity parameters. The 3-D structure causes the conventional 2-D esti- mates of impedances to be site-dependent mixtures of the regional impedance responses, with the strike esti- mate being strongly determined by the orientation of the local current. For strong 3-D electric scattering, the local current polarization azimuth is mainly determined by the local 3-D scattering rather than the regional currents. There are strong similarities among the 2-D rotation estimates of impedance and the eigenvalue estimates of impedance both by Eggers’s and Spitz’s first parameter- ization as well as the characteristic values of LaTorraca et al. There are striking similarities among the conven- tional estimate of strike, the orientations given by the Eggers’s, Spitz’s (Q), and LaTorraca et al.‘s decompo- sitions, as well as the estimate of local current polariza- tion azimuth given by Groom and Bailey. It was found that one of the ellipticities of Eggers, LaTorraca et al., and Spitz is identically zero for all sites and all periods, indicating that one eigenvalue or characteristic value is linearly polarized. There is strong evidence that this eigenvalue is related to the local current. For these three methods, the other ellipticity differs from zero only when there are significant differences in the phases of the regional 2-D impedances (i.e., strong 2-D inductive ef- fects), implying the second ellipticity indicates a multi- dimensional inductive response. Spitz’s second parameterization (Cr), and the Groom and Bailey decomposition, were able to re- cover information regarding the actual regional 2-D strike and the separate character of the 2-D regional impedances. Unconstrained, both methods can suffer from noise in their ability to resolve structural infor- mation especially when the current distortion causes the impedance tensor to be approximately singular. The method of Groom and Bailey, designed specifi- cally for quantifying the fit of the measured tensors to the physics of the parameterization, constraining a model, and resolving parameters, can recover much of the information in the two regional impedances and some information about the local structure.},

Even though$\backslash$nthe inductive behavior is 2-D, the resulting impedance tensor can$\backslash$nbe shown to have three-dimensional (3-D) behavior. Conventional procedures$\backslash$nfor rotating the impedance tensor such as minimizing the mean square$\backslash$nmodulus of the diagonal elements do not in general recover the principal$\backslash$naxes of induction and thus do not recover the correct principal impedances$\backslash$nbut rather linear combinations of them.

Where the impedance tensor is actually$\backslash$nthe result of regional 1-D or 2-D induction coupled with local frequency$\backslash$nindependent telluric distortion, the method correctly recovers the$\backslash$nprincipal axes of induction and, except for a static shift (multiplication$\backslash$nby a frequency independent real constant), the two principal impedances.$\backslash$nAlso obtained are two parameters (twist and shear), which partially$\backslash$ndescribe the effects of telluric distortion.

abstract = {This paper primarily examines the effects of small-scale or near-surface conductivity inhomogeneities on the magnetotelluric (MT) impedance tensor. These effects cause three different types of distortion results. (1) The well-known static shifts of sounding curves. (2) When the underlying regional setting is two-dimensional then the two regional impedances are mixed in an arbitrary coordinate system. Thus the level and shape of each sounding curve is distorted as are the phases. (3) At sufficiently high frequencies these effects generate anomalous magnetic fields that in turn alter the background phases. This tutorial first explores the usefulness of various MT tensor analysis techniques to overcome the problem of phase mixing and to recover regional information in the presence of local geological noise. Synthetic and experimental data are considered. A sequence of a priori models of increasing complexity are described. The use of appropriate decompositions of the MT tensor each with an increasing number of parameters is emphasised. In a second part, phase mixing and static shifts are examined from a synoptic view. Some static shift removal techniques that can be used in conjunction with the decomposition are discussed. This paper is not a review but rather an investigation of a few methods that the authors have found useful with field data.},

abstract = {A straightforward inversion scheme (SIS) has been developed to interpret vertical electrical sounding data. This scheme does not require quasi-linearization of the inverse resistivity problem and thereby dispenses with the iterative process and the necessity of guessing the number of layers and their resistivities and thicknesses. The entire solution domain is divided into uniform thick- ness layers, whose scale must be judiciously selected for the desired resolution. The apparent resistivity formula can now be posed as an underdetermined matrix equa- tion whose minimum norm solution is downward contin- ued to obtain the reflection coefficients which, in turn, yield the vertical resistivity distribution.Arecurrence re- lation has been developed especially for this purpose. In general, when data are expected to be noisy, a regressed minimum norm solution is used. Exhaustive tests of the algorithm have established its numerical efficiency. Re- sults of six typical synthetic models, representing diverse geological conditions, as well as results of two field ex- amples are included to demonstrate this claim},

abstract = {In the paper the principles of a new inversion method as well as the results of its application are described by using synthetic and field VES data. The basic idea of the method says that the horizontal changes in the layer thicknesses and the resistivities of the 2-D geological structure can be described by (expanding in series) functions of one variable. The coefficients of the functions are determined from the VES data by simultaneous inversion method using a least-squares technique. The local thicknesses and the resistivities of the geological structure are calculated from the coefficients from point to point along the profile. Using this method, the equivalence can considerably be reduced, and by using the functions chosen on the basis of a priori knowledge, the whole geological model can be determined by this inversion method. In the inversion the local 1-D forward modelling is used and this approximation is often applied in the VES practice. To qualify the results of the inversion, the correlation matrix for the coefficients are calculated and the error values for the local model parameters are introduced.},

@article{Haber2000,
abstract = {This paper considers optimization techniques for the solution of nonlinear inverse problems where the forward problems, like those encountered in electromagnetics, are modelled by differential equations. Such problems are often solved by utilizing a Gauss-Newton method in which the forward model constraints are implicitly incorporated. Variants of Newton's method which use second-derivative information are rarely employed because their perceived disadvantage in computational cost per step offsets their potential benefits of faster convergence. In this paper we show that, by formulating the inversion as a constrained or unconstrained optimization problem, and by employing sparse matrix techniques, we can carry out variants of sequential quadratic programming and the full Newton iteration with only a modest additional cost. By working with the differential equation explicitly we are able to relate the constrained and the unconstrained formulations and discuss the advantages of each. To make the comparisons meaningful we adopt the same global optimization strategy for all inversions. As an illustration, we focus upon a 1D electromagnetic (EM) example simulating a magnetotelluric survey. This problem is sufficiently rich that it illuminates most of the computational complexities that are prevalent in multi-source inverse problems and we therefore describe its solution process in detail. The numerical results illustrate that variants of Newton's method which utilize second-derivative information can produce a solution in fewer iterations and, in some cases where the data contain significant noise, requiring fewer floating point operations than Gauss-Newton techniques. Although further research is required, we believe that the variants proposed here will have a significant impact on developing practical solutions to large-scale 3D EM inverse problems.},

Such problems are solved through regularization and iteration and a major computational problem arises because the regularization parameter is not known a priori. In this paper we show that the regularization should be made up of two parts. A global regularization parameter is required to deal with the measurement noise, and a local regularization is needed to deal with the nonlinearity. We suggest the generalized cross validation (GCV) as a method to estimate the global regularization parameter and the damped Gauss-Newton to impose local regularization. Our algorithm is tested on the magnetotelluric problem. In the second part of this paper we develop a methodology to implement our algorithm on large-scale problems. We show that hybrid regularization methods can successfully estimate the global regularization parameter. Our algorithm is tested on a large gravimetric problem.},

abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing is widely used for initiating and subsequently propagating fractures in reservoir strata by means of a pressurized fluid to release oil and gas or to store industry waste. Downhole or surface microseismic monitoring is commonly used to characterize the hydraulically induced fractures. However, in some cases, downhole microseismic monitoring can be difficult due to the limitation imposed by boreholes. Surface microseismic monitoring often faces difficulties acquiring high signal-to-noise ratio data because of the on-site noise from hydraulic fracturing process. Research and field observations indicate that injecting conductive slurry or water into a strata may generate distinct time-lapse electromagnetic anomalies between pre- and posthydraulic fracturing. These anomalies provide a means for characterizing the hydraulic fracturing using time-lapse electromagnetic methods. We examined the time-lapse variation over an hour, one day, one month, and two years of observed audio-magnetotellurics (AMT) resistivity and the 1D and 3D AMT modeling result of the variation pre- and posthydraulic fracturing. There is also a successful case history of applying the time-lapse AMT to map hydraulic fractures. Observed data indicate that the variation of AMT resistivity is normally less than 6\% apart from the data of the dead band and some noisy data. Modeling results show the variation pre- and posthydraulic fracturing is larger than 30\% at the frequency point lower than 100 Hz. The case history indicates that time-lapse magnetotelluric monitoring may form a new way to characterize the hydraulic fracture.},

abstract = {In Sanfu, Qaidam basin, China, traditional geophysical methods have failed to find subtle hydrocarbon reservoirs. In an attempt to predict and delineate gas reservoirs, we used a type of magnetotelluric (MT) profiling called 3D continuous electromagnetic profiling (CEMP). Electric logs indicate that gas-bearing formations have high resistivity relative to nongas-bearing formations. Obvious resistivity anomalies derived from MT sounding curves are interpreted to come from gas-bearing formations; we observed no such anomalous resistivity away from gas-bearing reservoirs. For CEMP, five electric components were recorded at each station; the inline electric components of all stations were measured using dipoles placed end to end. Becausethe survey area was quite wide, we divided it into three rectangular blocks for data processing and inversion. After noise removal and static corrections, the data from each block were inverted with a 3D nonlinear conjugate-gradient inversion method to obtain the spatial distribution of resistivity. Using this resistivity, we created a 2D model, which we inverted to determine the induced polarization (IP) parameters. We found that a high-resistivity anomaly and high IP anomaly are two key indicators when predicting and delineating the location of gas-bearing reservoirs. In our case study, a known gas-bearing formation had a high-resistivity anomaly and a high IP anomaly. We identified two similar anomalous regions outside the known gas-bearing formations. As a result, two new prospects were determined as targets worth drilling.  2010 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

abstract = {Geothermal reservoirs are characterized by their fluid chemistry, natural heat loss and reservoir structure. A revised classification of low (\&lt;125\^{A}°C), intermediate (125\^{a}€“225\^{A}°C), and high (\&gt;225\^{A}°C) temperature reservoirs has been given. Almost all types of geothermal reservoirs can be used for small plant development. Three different approaches have been used for assessment of geothermal reservoirs, namely: (a) assessment of gross power potential (volume approach), (2) assessment of productivity of wells and, (3) assessment of productivity potential by computer modelling. Assessment of reservoirs to be developed for small plants is restricted in that it can only be based on data of a few exploration wells; such assessment has to occur at the end of the exploration drilling phase. Power potential estimates are of limited use for adequate reservoir assessment since the permeability structure of the reservoir is neglected. Productivity assessments of exploratory wells can explain the behaviour of wells but do not allow an assessment of any major part of the reservoir. A gross permeability structure of convective reservoirs, however, can be obtained by modelling the reservoir in its natural state. The model can be used to predict the reservoir response for various utilization schemes with different fluid production characteristics. The predicted productivity potential depends therefore both on the permeability structure of the reservoir and fluid production parameters. Numerous examples (mainly from developing countries) have been cited which show that assessment of productivity potential can be extended to most types of geothermal reservoirs. Although reservoir assessment by modelling appears to be a generally suitable method, it requires access to large computers and is time consuming. Its predictive power is limited by equivalence problems and poor input models, but the same problems also affect other assessments.

abstract = {A Z-Axis Tipper Electromagnetic Technique (ZTEM) survey is an airborne natural source electromagnetic survey that relates the vertical magnetic field to the horizontal magnetic fields measured at a reference station on the ground. For large airborne surveys, the high number of cells required to discretize the entire area at a reasonable resolution can make the computational cost of inverting the data set all at once prohibitively expensive. We present an iterative methodology that can be used to invert large natural source surveys by using a combination of coarse and fine meshes as well as a domain decomposition that allows the full model area to be split into smaller subproblems, which can be run in parallel. For this procedure, the entire data set is first inverted on a coarse mesh. The recovered coarse model and computed fields are used as starting models and source terms in the subsequent tiled inversions. After each round of tiled inversions, the tiles are merged together to form an update model, which is then forward modeled to determine if the model achieves the target misfit. Following this procedure, we first invert the data computed from a large synthetic model of the Noranda mining camp. The inverted models from this example are consistent among our different tiling choices. The recovered models show excellent large-scale agreement with the true model and they also recover several of the mineralized zones that were not apparent from the initial coarse inversion. Finally, we invert a 30×30 km block of the 2010 ZTEM survey collected over the porphyry Pebble Deposit in Alaska. The inverted ZTEM results are consistent with the results obtained using other electromagnetic methods. © 2012 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

abstract = {Z-Axis Tipper Electromagnetic Technique (ZTEM) data are airborne electromagnetic data which record the vertical magnetic field that results from natural sources. The data are transfer functions that relate the local vertical field to orthogonal horizontal fields measured at a reference station on the ground. The transfer functions depend on frequency and provide information about the 3-D conductivity structure of the Earth. The practical frequency range is 30-720 Hz and hence it is possible to see structures at depths of a kilometre or more if the earth is of moderate conductivity. This depth of penetration is significantly greater than that obtained with controlled source EM techniques and, when coupled with rapid spatial acquisition with an airborne system, means that ZTEM data can be used to map large-scale structures that are difficult to survey with ground based surveys. We present some fundamentals about understanding the signatures obtained with ZTEM transfer functions and then develop a Gauss-Newton algorithm to invert ZTEM data. The algorithm is applied to synthetic examples and to a field data set from the Bingham Canyon region in Utah. The field data set requires a workflow procedure to estimate appropriate noise levels in individual frequency components. These noise levels can then be used to invert multiple frequencies simultaneously. ZTEM data are insensitive to a 1-D conductivity structures and hence the background can be difficult to estimate. We provide two methods to determine appropriate background models. Interestingly, topography, which is usually a hinderance in field data interpretation, provides a first-order signal in the ZTEM data and helps with this calibration. © 2010 The Authors Journal compilation © 2010 RAS.},

abstract = {We have developed a frequency-domain joint electromagnetic (EM) and seismic inversion algorithm for reservoir evaluation and exploration applications. EM and seismic data are jointly inverted using a cross-gradient constraint that enforces structural similarity between the conductivity image and the compressional wave (P-wave) velocity image. The inversion algorithm is based on a Gauss-Newton optimization approach. Because of the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, regularization is used to constrain the solution. The multiplicative regularization technique selects the regularization parameters automatically, improving the robustness of the algorithm. A multifrequency data-weighting scheme prevents the high-frequency data from dominating the inversion process. When the joint-inversion algorithm is applied in integrating marine controlled-source electromagnetic data with surface seismic data for subsea reservoir exploration applications and in integrating crosswell EM and sonic data for reservoir monitoring and evaluation applications, results improve significantly over those obtained from separate EM or seismic inversions.

abstract = {Audiomagnetotelluric and magnetotelluric soundings have been obtained at 11 sites on a south-north line across the Broadlands-Ohaaki geothermal field. The orientation of the line is approximately parallel to the eastern boundary of the Central Volcanic Region of the North Island of New Zealand and makes anything other than one-dimensional quantitative modelling difficult. As the data quality is generally good and the measured apparent resistivities are isotropic at high frequencies it is believed that one-dimensional modelling gives, in this instance, an accurate picture of the structure of the geothermal field. This is supported by the excellent agreement between the structure obtained and the available borehole, geological and geophysical information. The modelling results clearly show a very low resistivity layer which may be identified with the upper aquifer of the geothermal reservoir. Beneath the field the depth to this layer varies from 100 m to ∼ 450 m. This low-resistivity region associated with the reservoir appears to extend well to the south of the field at a depth of ∼ 1.5 km. In contrast, the northern boundary of the field is relatively abrupt. Beneath the field the very low resistivity zone is underlain by a resistivity of ∼ 20 $\omega$ m which extends to several kilometres deep and which in at least the upper 1 km can be identified with the circulation of geothermal fluids. There is also some tentative evidence of a second conducting region, possibly marking the base of the crust, at a depth of ∼ 20 km.},

abstract = {ZTEM airborne electromagnetic surveys over the Copaquire porphyry deposit, in northern Chile, were designed to map its alteration and structure due resistivity contrasts, to depth, based on successful applications of the method in north America. ZTEM is an airborne variant of the AFMAG passive EM method whose source fields are related to world-wide thunderstorm activity. The ZTEM results over Copaquire appear to map the resistive potassic alteration associated with known Marta and Cerro Moly porphyries, below the surficial secondary enrichment layer and extending to depth. These are in turn surrounded by more conductive, barren pyrite-rich phyllic and propyllitic alteration. Over the other two known mineralized prospects, at Sulfato North and South, the ZTEM results are different, with more resistive rocks at surface becoming more conductive at depth - perhaps reflecting a different geologic setting. Overall, these results are consistent with ZTEM results obtained over other, similar calc-alkalyne porphyry systems and also agree with the known geology. © 2011 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

abstract = {Previous modeling investigations of the static shift of magnetotelluric (MT) apparent resistivity curves have limited appeal in that the electric fields used were point measurements, whereas field observations are of voltage differences. Thus, inhomogeneities of dimension of the order of the electrode line length could not be investigated. In this paper, by using a modeling algorithm that derives point voltages rather than point electric fields, I consider the effect on the MT responses of local near-surface distorting structures, which are both outside of, and inside, the telluric electrode array. I show that static-shift effects are of larger spatial size but of less magnitude than would be expected from conventional modeling. Also, the field observation that static shift affects only the apparent resistivity curve but not the phase response can be replicated by the voltage difference modeling.If there exists within the earth a layer whose variation in electrical resistivity along the profile can be treated in a parametric fashion, then static shift of the apparent resistivity curves can be corrected. Deriving the modal value from a sufficient number of observations for the layer resistivity is the most useful approach.},

abstract = {A magnetotelluric survey in the frequency range of approximately 0.01–130 Hz was conducted in west-central Alberta, Canada, in an area where a deep electrical conductivity anomaly, discovered from geomagnetic depth sounding studies, coincides with a geothermal gradient anomaly in the basin sediments. One-dimensional Fischer inversions of the determinant invariants at each site were used to construct resistivity cross-sections for a number of profiles. The results indicate that a number of low-resistivity zones exists in the sediments. These zones appear to be associated with saline fluids which may have moved upward along faults and fractures from the southwest and transported heat to produce the thermal anomaly and probably also carried hydrocarbons into the area. There is also evidence of a deeper low-resistivity zone (compared with the basement resistivity values in the rest of central Alberta) that appears to extend to depth and may be related to the depth sounding anomaly. It is unlikely that this conductive zone contributes substantially to the local geothermal anomaly in the upper sediments, but it may contribute to the slightly higher than normal heat flow in the area as a whole.},

There is no proper management of the waste disposal site in which industrial and domestic wastes were improperly dumped. Furthermore, because of the dumpsite is being located at the catchment area borders of a small creek and is being topographically at a high elevation relative to the urban area, the groundwater is expected to be hazardously contaminated. Interpretations of DC resistivity geoelectrical data showed a low resistivity zone (<5 ohm-m), which appears to be a zone, that is fully saturated with leachate from an open dumpsite. The VLF-EM and SP method, support the results of geoelectrical method relating a contaminated zone in the survey area.

abstract = {The first magnetotelluric study in the Marmara Sea, Turkey, was undertaken to resolve the structure of the crust and upper mantle in the region, and to determine the location of the westward extension of the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) in the \c{C} inarcik area. Long-period ocean bottom magnetotelluric data were acquired at six sites along two profiles crossing the \c{C} inarcik Basin, where a significant increase in microseismic activity was observed following the devastating 1999 ?Izmit andD\"{u}zce earthquakes. 2-D resistivity models indicate the existence of a conductor at a depth of\~{}10 km in the middle of both profiles along with a deeper extension into the upper mantle, implying the presence of fluid in the crust and partial melting in the upper mantle. The northern and southern boundaries of this conductor are interpreted to represent the northern and southern branches of the NAF in the Marmara Sea, respectively. These conductors have been previously identified farther to the east along the NAF, suggesting that the electrical characteristics of this fault are continuous from onland areas into the Marmara Sea. Microseismic activity in the \c{C} inarcik area is located above the conductor documented here, and indicates a possible seismogenic role of crustal fluids present in the conductive zone. In comparison, resistive zones along the NAF may act as asperities that could eventually result in a large earthquake. © The Authors 2013.

abstract = {Kimberlite pipes are significant source rocks that form primary diamond deposits. Usually, the low resistivity of kimberlite produces a significant contrast in electrical resistivity, which can be mapped using electromagnetic EM methods. The Regis kimberlite is located in a well-known diamondiferous province in central Brazil. The main tectonic feature of the area is a northwest–southeast major crustal fracture zone that extends for more than 3000km within the Brazilian territory, where Regis and several other kimberlites have intruded. In this paper, we present an audiomagnetotelluric (AMT) study at the Regis pipe. AMT data were collected in the 10Hz–100kHz frequency range at 111 stations on a grid, and three-dimensional (3D) inversions were used to generate a resistivity model of the pipe. Our interpretation was corroborated by available geological information of six drill holes. The final model shows an asymmetric conically shaped body with a conductivity range of 2 to 70ohm.m and a depth of 0 to 550m. These conductive sources were associated with crater lake sediments in the upper part and the main kimberlite diatreme at depth.},

abstract = {Interpretation of magnetotelluric (MT) data for three-dimensional (3-D) regional conductivity structures remains uncommon, and two-dimensional (2-D) models are often considered an adequate approach. In this paper we examine 2-D interpretation of 3-D data by considering the synthetic responses of a 3-D structure chosen specifically to highlight the advantages and limitations of 2-D interpretation. 2-D modelswere obtained from inversion of the synthetic 3-D data set with different conditions (noise and distortion) applied to the data. We demonstrate the importance of understanding galvanic distortion of the data and show how 2-D inversion is improvedwhen the regional data are corrected prior to modelling. When the 3-D conductive structure is located below the profile, the models obtained suggest that the effects of finite strike are not significant if the structure has a strike extent greater than about one-half of a skin depth. In this case the use of only TM-mode data determined better the horizontal extent of the 3-D anomaly. When the profiles are located away from the 3-D conductive structure the use of only TM-mode data can imagine phantom conductive structures below the profile, in this case the use of both polarizations produced a better determination of the subsurface structures. It is important to note that the main structures are identified in all the cases considered here, although in some cases the large data misfit would cause scepticism about features of the models.},

abstract = {The present study aims at building a 3-D density model of a whole collisional mountain belt at the lithospheric scale. The geometry of internal structures is constrained by seismic studies, while density values are imposed by petrological considerations. The model must fit both the Bouguer and geoid anomalies. This approach is applied to the Pyrenees, for which numerous geophysical data are available. The crustal structure is constrained from the results of seismic profiles. The most important crustal Feature is the large Moho jump which coincides with the surface expression of the North pyrenean Fault. considered as the suture between the Iberian and Eurasian plates. The Eurasian crust Is about 30 km thick, whereas the Iberian crust is 50 km thick in the central part of the range. Thick sedimentary basins at the Piedmont. and two large heavy intracrustal bodies located in the western and central parts of the range, are also important Features of the crustal model. At the lithospheric scale, a low-velocity strip under the North Pyrenean Fault down to 80-100 km depth. interpreted as the subduction of the Iberian lower crust, has been revealed by tomographic models. The density of this structure has been constrained using petrological arguments, which assume that the crustal material is transformed into eclogite at about 12-15 kbar (40-50 km depth). An eclogite-type density value, much higher than the mantle density, is thus imposed from 50 to 100 km depth. Theoretical Bouguer and geoid anomalies are computed for this 3-D density model using a summation of density block anomalies. A good agreement is found with observations, giving strong support to the proposed model. The crustal structure, as seen by seismic profiles, explains most of the observed long-wavelength negative Bouguer anomaly, as well the local anomalies related to the intracrustal bodies. A possible mantle origin of these bodies is ruled out. On the other hand, the transformation of the subducted loir;er crust into dense eclogite provides a successful tit to the long-wavelength positive geoid anomalies. In addition, the water released during eclogite formation may help to explain the high conductivity zone detected down to 80 km south of the North Pyrenean Fault. The 3-D model proposed here thus reconciles petrological considerations and geophysical data.},

abstract = {Geothermal resources have been classified as low, medium and high enthalpy resources according to their reservoir fluid temperatures. There is no general agreement on the arbitrary temperature ranges used. Classification of a geothermal resource by its reservoir fluid temperature can be ambiguous because two independent properties are required to define the thermodynamic state of a fluid. Geothermal resources should be classified to reflect their ability to do thermodynamic work. In this paper, it is proposed that geothermal resources be classified as low, medium and high quality resources with reference to their specific exergy indices (SExI), SExI<0.05, 0.05⩽SExI<0.5 and SExI⩾0.5, respectively. The demarcation limits for these indices are exergies of saturated water and dry saturated steam at 1 bar absolute. These demarcation lines can be plotted on a Mollier diagram to form a classification map of geothermal resources.},

abstract = {ZTEM (Z-Tipper Axis Electromagnetic) airborne AFMAG surveys have been conducted over geothermal test areas such as Reese River, in central Nevada, since 2009. The Reese River prospect is a "blind" geothermal resource that lacks surface characteristics such as hot springs. A number of geophysical surveys have been conducted at the prospect, including seismic, gravity, magnetotelluric (MT) and radiometric surveys. Resistivity methods, such as MT, are typically used to map structure, lithology and alteration, particularly the smectite-zeolite zones which form a low resistivity cap over the outer margins of the higher resistive reservoir at depth. The ZTEM survey at Reese River overflew lines previously surveyed using MT for comparison purposes. The ZTEM results appear to correlate very well with previous magnetotelluric results and the known geology, in particular the presence of both major and secondary fault structures and geologic contacts. 2D inversions of the airborne ZTEM appear to agree very well with the inversions obtained from ground MT. 3D joint MT-ZTEM inversion results improve the quality of the subsurface resistivity structure.

@article{Lehmann1999,
abstract = {Image interpolation techniques often are required in medical imaging for image generation (e.g., discrete back projection for inverse Radon transform) and processing such as compression or resampling. Since the ideal interpolation function spatially is unlimited, several interpolation kernels of finite size have been introduced. This paper compares 1) truncated and windowed sinc; 2) nearest neighbor; 3) linear; 4) quadratic; 5) cubic B-spline; 6) cubic; g) Lagrange; and 7) Gaussian interpolation and approximation techniques with kernel sizes from 1 x 1 up to 8 x 8. The comparison is done by: 1) spatial and Fourier analyses; 2) computational complexity as well as runtime evaluations; and 3) qualitative and quantitative interpolation error determinations for particular interpolation tasks which were taken from common situations in medical image processing. For local and Fourier analyses, a standardized notation is introduced and fundamental properties of interpolators are derived. Successful methods should be direct current (DC)-constant and interpolators rather than DC-inconstant or approximators. Each method's parameters are tuned with respect to those properties. This results in three novel kernels, which are introduced in this paper and proven to be within the best choices for medical image interpolation: the 6 x 6 Blackman-Harris windowed sinc interpolator, and the C2-continuous cubic kernels with N = 6 and N = 8 supporting points. For quantitative error evaluations, a set of 50 direct digital X rays was used. They have been selected arbitrarily from clinical routine. In general, large kernel sizes were found to be superior to small interpolation masks. Except for truncated sinc interpolators, all kernels with N = 6 or larger sizes perform significantly better than N = 2 or N = 3 point methods (p < 0.005). However, the differences within the group of large-sized kernels were not significant. Summarizing the results, the cubic 6 x 6 interpolator with continuous second derivatives, as defined in (24), can be recommended for most common interpolation tasks. It appears to be the fastest six-point kernel to implement computationally. It provides eminent local and Fourier properties, is easy to implement, and has only small errors. The same characteristics apply to B-spline interpolation, but the 6 x 6 cubic avoids the intrinsic border effects produced by the B-spline technique. However, the goal of this study was not to determine an overall best method, but to present a comprehensive catalogue of methods in a uniform terminology, to define general properties and requirements of local techniques, and to enable the reader to select that method which is optimal for his specific application in medical imaging.},

abstract = {A study of the geoelectrical structure of the central part of Piton de la Fournaise volcano (Reunion, Indian Ocean) was made using direct current electrical (DC) and transient electromagnetic soundings (TEM). Piton de la Fournaise is a highly active oceanic basaltic shield and has been active for more than half a million years. Joint interpretation of the DC and TEM data allows us to obtain reliable 1D models of the resistivity distribution. The depth of investigation is of the order of 1.5 km but varies with the resistivity pattern encountered at each sounding. Two-dimensional resistivity cross sections were constructed by interpolation between the soundings of the 1D interpreted models. Conductors with resistivities less than 100 ohm-m are present at depth beneath all of the soundings and are located high in the volcanic edifice at elevations between 2000 and 1200 m. The deepest conductor has a resistivity less than 20 ohm-m for soundings located inside the Enclos and less than 60-100 ohm-m for soundings outside the Enclos. From the resistivity distributions, two zones are distinguished: (a) the central zone of the Enclos; and (b) the outer zone beyond the Enclos. Beneath the highly active summit area, the conductor rises to within a few hundred meters of the surface. This bulge coincides with a 2000-mV self-potential anomaly. Low-resistivity zones are inferred to show the presence of a hydrothermal system where alteration by steam and hot water has lowered the resistivity of the rocks. Farther from the summit, but inside the Enclos, the depth to the conductive layers increases to approximately 1 km and is inferred to be a deepening of the hydrothermally altered zone. Outside of the Enclos, the nature of the deep, conductive layers is not established. The observed resistivities suggest the presence of hydrated minerals, which could be found in landslide breccias, in hydrothermally altered zones, or in thick pyroclastic layers. Such formations often create perched water tables. The known occurrence of large eastward-moving landslides in the evolution of Piton de la Fournaise strongly suggests that large volumes of breccias should exist in the interior of the volcano; however, extensive breccia deposits are not observed at the bottom of the deep valleys that incise the volcano to elevations lower than those determined for the top of the conductors. The presence of the center of Piton de la Fournaise beneath the Plaine des Sables area during earlier volcanic stages (ca. 0.5 to 0.150 Ma) may have resulted in broad hydrothermal alteration of this zone. However, this interpretation cannot account for the low resistivities in peripheral zones. It is not presently possible to discriminate between these general interpretations. In addition, the nature of the deep conductors may be different in each zone. Whatever the geologic nature of these conductive layers, their presence indicates a major change of lithology at depth, unexpected for a shield volcano such as Piton de la Fournaise.},

Analysis of impedance tensors and tipper vectors for a layered half-space shows that the impedance tensor can be antidiagonalized by rotating the measurement system so that one of the measurement directions coincides with the direction to the transmitter dipole. The tipper vector points towards the transmitter dipole. In the static limit, all transfer functions are real. and simple analytic results for a homogeneous half-space show that impedance elements are proportional to the in- verse of the product of conductivity and distance between source and receiver, while the tipper vector is a unit vector pointing towards the transmitter dipole},

abstract = {We applied tensor radio magnetotellurics (RMT) in the 10–250 kHz frequency range to study major fracture zones on ¨Avr¨o, a small island (1.6×1.2 km2) in south- eastern Sweden with bedrock dominated by highly re- sistive granite. The interpretation of a 950-m RMT pro- file was facilitated by seismic reflection and borehole data but was complicated (1) by possible 3D effects of the surrounding sea and (2) because the quasi-static as- sumption is violated. Inversions basedonthe quasi-static assumption give severely distorted models in this type of environment. Inversion codes that include displace- ment currents are restricted to 1D structures. Therefore, 2D inversions were applied to lower frequencies only. The central part of the inverted profile showed a 30–40- m-thick weathered layer over an almost intact bedrock down to a depth of at least 200 m, where higher salin- ity and/or fracturing yielded higher conductivities. The first 200mof the profile revealed a major fracture zone, which coincided with a seismic reflector.We used3Dfor- ward modeling to understand the sea effect and to model the conductor in three dimensions. We believe that 3D forward modeling is a highly valuable tool to distinguish known 3D effects (i.e., the sea) from regional 2D fea- tures of interest. We suggest that water flow at ¨Avr¨ois dominated by a few major fracture zones},

To ameliorate this situation, we develop a sequenced MT inversion workflow that formalizes and improves upon concepts introduced by Rosenkjaer and Oldenberg (2012). We test the performance and reliability of our workflow using five 3D MT datasets from geothermal fields in the United States (Coso, Raft River) and Iceland (Krafla, Hengill and Krysuvik). We compare inversion results from the standard and sequenced workflows for each experiment, and find that the sequenced workflow always retrieves a better-fitting model, specifically at lower frequencies, which is geologically consistent and representative of a high temperature geothermal system. It also uses fewer computational resources.},

abstract = {Laboratory measurements of various materials suggest that more information can be obtained by measuring the in-phase and out-of-phase potentials at a number of frequencies. One common model used to describe the variation of the electrical properties with frequency is the Cole-Cole model. Apart from the DC resistivity ($\rho$) and chargeability (m) parameters used in conventional induced-polarization (IP) surveys, the Cole-Cole model has two additional parameters, i.e. the time ($\tau$) and relaxation (c) constants. Much research has been conducted on the use of the additional Cole-Cole parameters to distinguish between different IP sources. Here, we propose a modified inversion method to recover the Cole-Cole parameters from a 2D spectral IP (SIP) survey. In this method, an approximate inversion method is initially used to construct a non-homogeneous starting model for the resistivity and chargeability values. The 2D model consists of a number of rectangular cells with constant resistivity ($\rho$), chargeability (m), time ($\tau$) and relaxation (c) constant values in each cell. A regularized least-squares optimization method is then used to recover the time and relaxation constant parameters as well as to refine the chargeability values in the 2D model. We present results from tests carried out with the proposed method for a synthetic data set as well as from a laboratory tank experiment.},

abstract = {A computerized method is described for calculating an image of the refractive index distribution in a plane bounded by two underground boreholes. The scanning geometry is assumed to be limited to probing from borehole to borehole, with rays at numerous depths and angles to effectively cover the cross section between holes. A geometrical optics model is assumed for the transmission data. We stress situations where significant bending of electromagnetic or seismic rays occurs. Image reconstruction involves an iterated sequence of numerical ray tracing and linear system inversion. A similar approach, discussed in the literature, sometimes fails to converge. We report here our refinements of this method, including use of a smoothness constraint.},

abstract = {We have developed an inversion procedure that uses conjugate gradient relaxation methods. Although one can generalize the method to all inverse problems, we demonstrate its use to invert magnetotelluric data for 3-D earth models. This procedure allows us to bypass the actual computation of the sensitivity matrix A or the inversion of the A(T)A term. In fact, with the relaxation approach, one only needs to compute the effect of the sensitivity matrix or its transpose multiplying an arbitrary vector. We show that each of these requires one forward problem with a distributed set of sources either in the volume (for A multiplying a vector) or on the surface (for A(T) multiplying a vector). This significantly reduces the computational requirements needed to do a 3-D inversion. For this paper, we have simplified the boundary conditions by assuming the model is repeated in the horizontal directions, but this is not a necessary constraint of the method. The algorithm reduces data errors to the 2 per cent level for noise-free synthetic 3-D magnetotelluric data.},

@article{Mahseredjian1997,
abstract = {The traditional method for developing electric network analysis computer programs is based on coding using a conventional computer language: FORTRAN, C or Pascal. The programming language of the EMTP (Electromagnetic Transients Program) is FORTRAN-77. Such a program has a closed architecture and uses a large number of code lines to satisfy requirements ranging from low level data manipulation to the actual solution mathematics which eventually become diluted and almost impossible to visualize. This paper proposes a new design idea suitable for EMTP re-development in a high level programming context. It presents the creation of the transient analysis numerical simulator MatEMTP in the computational engine frame of MATLAB. Most network solution and modeling methods are simple to visualize and support mathematically, but their translation into an actual large scale working code is complex. Commonly used programming languages are ill-suited to human abilities for dealing with complexity. Software built using such languages is often inadequate. Some other new languages such as ADA, C++ and FORTRAN-90, provide pow-erful features for the formulation of appropriate abstractions for the desired application. But programming is always easier if a specialized language is already available for the creation of similar applications. Specialized applications should use dedicated computational engines where the developer can build and compose with high level constructs. In addition to defining a new library of functions and overloading existing operators, such an engine must provide a minimal number of portable graphical data visualization and manipulation functions. It is obvious that programming a computational engine from scratch is a major effort. This paper proposes to use a widely used general purpose program available on most popular computer platforms as a computational engine: MATLAB. MATLAB has a large number of built-in functions and constructs covering a wide range of EMTP development needs and is expandable by means, of optional toolboxes. The recent implementation of sparse matrix manipulation capabilities eliminates a major feasibility barrier. This paper presents the creation of MatEMTP: a transient analysis program in MATLAB M-files. It is based on a new formulation of the main system of network equations, designed to eliminate several topological data restrictions and capable of handling arbitrary switch interconnections. By programming through matrix and vector operations the MatEMTP code is naturally vectorized. To eliminate useless testing, initialization procedures and repetitive dead code executions, the readyto-run structure of Figure 1 is proposed. This data adaptable structure relies on the input processor to interconnect the M-files. The input processor is a separate program that decodes standard EMTP data files and creates the case.m file. This file is a processed file of network data created from the external case data format. The model selector is a set of M-files created by the input processor for connecting required case.m models to the main program. All models are programmed in separate M-files that obey to a set of predefined core code requests. A typical request for a component model is "provide admittance matrix" or "update history". The creation of any new model is as1 simple as programming a new M-file which is automatically recognized and inserted into the appropriate code location by the model selector. The organizer is another M-file created by the input processor that calls solution M-files according to selected options and overall solution needs. Thus, MatEMTP is based on a data dependent interconnection of individual code modules. Used algorithms provide results identical to those from the EMTP. However, the proposed environment is implemented in very few lines of code, is easily expandable, modifiable and highly portable. It also eliminates EMTP modeling limitations through a less restrictive formulation of main network equations. Although in a few cases the new environment is faster, in general studies show that the conventional coding retains a speed advantage ranging from 2.5:1 in the best case to 10:1 in the worst case. Ideas for reducing this ratio are proposed. The ultimate contribution of this paper is a dramatic illustration of the possibilities afforded by this new approach to software development.},

The objective was to image an intrusion expected below the formation of 180m-high cryptodomes formed during the 1977-78 eruption. A NE–SW two-dimensional resistivity model has been obtained from the inversion in the frequency range from 0.01 to 10,000Hz. The major features of the resistivity section are as follows: (1) a 50-m-thick surficial resistive (1000–10,000$\Omega$m) layer corresponding to the lava layer; (2) a relatively conductive (10–1000$\Omega$m) layer from the surface to 200m depth, corresponding to Quaternary sedimentary and volcanic rocks; (3) beneath the Quaternary formations, a thick (2–4km) conductive (1–500$\Omega$m) layer of altered Tertiary volcanics distributed widely in the volcanic edifice; (4) a resistive block (500–1,000$\Omega$m) in the Tertiary layer from 200 to 400m in depth beneath the summit crater, forming a striking contrast to the rest of the conductive Tertiary layer and probably indicating a cooling intrusion at shallow depth; (5) pre-Tertiary formations consisting of a high resistivity (1000–10,000$\Omega$m) layer overlying a conductive layer, with the top of the Pre-Tertiary becoming shallow to the northeast; and (6) no deep conductive anomalies corresponding to a magma chamber inferred from petrological studies.},

abstract = {As part of a program to evaluate the utility of integrated geoelectrical methods for subsurface structural mapping and groundwater resource investigation in the semiarid eastern margin of the Parnaiba basin in Brazil, several vertical electrical soundings (VES) and transient electromagnetic (TEM) and tensorial audio-magnetotelluric (AMT) measurements were carried out along a 250-km-long east-west transect (passing through major towns and cities) and a 127-km-long north-south profile (passing through small farm settlements). The various data sets have been jointly processed using a novel integration scheme and a constrained 1-D inversion technique to yield the resistivity structure underneath each observation station. Regularized 2-D inversion of static-shift-corrected, dual-mode AMT data provided additional deep structural information and, together with the joint 1-D results, enabled an assessment of the distribution of aquifers and major structural controls in the region. The east-west regional geoelectrical model evokes a picture of a gently dipping succession of conductive and resistive units in good agreement with the alternating shaly and sandy formations evinced from preexisting borehole data and previous geological studies. The geoelectric models also show the presence of the large-scale Transbrazilian lineament and other graben-like structures, previously inferred from aeromagnetic data, which may have some control on groundwater distribution. The agreement with geology and aeromagnetic interpretation emphasizes the importance of integrated geoelectrical surveying as a complementary or independent means of obtaining useful stratigraphic and structural information for hydrogeological studies in this region.},

abstract = {Over the last half decade the need for, and importance of, three-dimensional (3-D) modelling of magnetotelluric (MT) data have increased dramatically and various 3-D forward and inversion codes are in use and some have become commonly available. Comparison of forward responses and inversion results is an important step for code testing and validation prior to 'production' use. The various codes use different mathematical approximations to the problem (finite differences, finite elements or integral equations), various orientations of the coordinate system, different sign conventions for the time dependence and various inversion strategies. Additionally, the obtained results are dependent on data analysis, selection and correction as well as on the chosen mesh, inversion parameters and regularization adopted, and therefore, a careful and knowledge-based use of the codes is essential. In 2008 and 2011, during two workshops at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies over 40 people from academia (scientists and students) and industry from around the world met to discuss 3-D MT inversion. These workshops brought together a mix of code writers as well as code users to assess the current status of 3-D modelling, to compare the results of different codes, and to discuss and think about future improvements and new aims in 3-D modelling. To test the numerical forward solutions, two 3-D models were designed to compare the responses obtained by different codes and/or users. Furthermore, inversion results of these two data sets and two additional data sets obtained from unknown models (secret models) were also compared. In this manuscript the test models and data sets are described (supplementary files are available) and comparisons of the results are shown. Details regarding the used data, forward and inversion parameters as well as computational power are summarized for each case, and the main discussion points of the workshops are reviewed. In general, the responses obtained from the various forward models are comfortingly very similar, and discrepancies are mainly related to the adopted mesh. For the inversions, the results show how the inversion outcome is affected by distortion and the choice of errors, as well as by the completeness of the data set. We hope that these compilations will become useful not only for those that were involved in the workshops, but for the entire MT community and also the broader geoscience community who may be interested in the resolution offered by MT. © The Authors 2013.

abstract = {The key element in the characterization, assessment and development of geothermal energy systems is the resource type. Throughout the past 30 years many resource type schemes and definitions were published, based on temperature and thermodynamic properties. An alternative possibility to cataloging geothermal energy systems is by their geologic characteristics, referred to as geothermal plays. Applied to worldwide case studies, a new catalog is developed based on the effects of geological controls and structural plate tectonic positions on thermal regime and heat flow, hydrogeologic regime, fluid dynamics, fluid chemistry, faults and fractures, stress regime, and lithological sequence. Understanding geologic controls, especially of geothermal plays without surface expression, allows the comparison with hydrocarbon reservoirs through their ratio of porosity and permeability. This analog has implications on site-specific, first class exploration strategies and reservoir improvement through technologies specifically suitable for unconventional sustainable energy reservoirs. This article aims to introduce geothermal plays to a wide geoscientific community and to initiate a geologically based cataloging of geothermal resources. With this new catalog of geothermal plays, it will be ultimately possible to transfer lessons learned not only within one specific catalog type, but also technology from geothermal plays to unconventional hydrocarbon plays and vice versa. © 2014 The Author.},

Synthetic data were used to test the effectiveness of the code and to examine the resolving capability of the Schlumberger array in investigating 3-D resistivity distributions. The code was applied to experimental data set constituted by 35 Schlumberger soundings collected near the Cairo city in order to study the subsurface resistivity distribution. The results have shown that valuable imaging of the subsurface resistivity distribution can be constructed even when the vertical electrical soundings are acquired in a sparse field data set. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {From Yunnan to Northern Thailand, Late Cenozoic-Recent faults strike predominantly NNE-SSW, N-S to NNE-SSW and NE-SW to ENE-WSW. Associated sedimentary basins are aligned NE-SW to N-S. The regional fault patterns are commonly interpreted as strike-slip dominated deformation throughout the area. Releasing bend and en echelon stepping patterns on faults bounding sedimentary basins indicate sinistral displacement on NE-SW to ENE-WSW trending faults. Yet, in the escape tectonics model left lateral displacement on the NE-SW to ENE-WSW faults is thought to have occurred late in the Miocene, whilst earlier motion was dextral. However, in Yunnan the NE-SW Shmax direction required for dextral motion on the N-S Sagaing, Nanting and Gaoligong fault zones is consistent with sinistral motion on ENE-WSW striking faults, which is still their sense of motion today. In Northern Thailand the dextral-sinistral switch model during the Miocene is not tenable because the Fang basin is of Late Oligocene-Pliocene age, and requires similar age sinistral motion on the ENE-WSW Mae Chan fault in order to have opened. In an alternative model, Northern Thailand is interpreted to have evolved predominantly by oblique extension. The Golden Triangle area marks a transition from transtensional deformation in the north to oblique extension in the south. The activation of pre-existing fabrics strongly affects both strike-slip and extensional faults and has given rise to the similar extensional and strike-slip fault patterns. Multiple episodes of basin inversion in Northern Thailand during the Miocene require short-term changes in stress pattern. To produce the inferred changes in stress pattern it is suggested that stresses radiating out from the Himalayan syntaxis exert a strong influence, but were not the only important forces acting on the region. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {Models for the Tertiary evolution of SE Asia fall into two main types: a pure escape tectonics model with no proto-South China Sea, and subduction of proto-South China Sea oceanic crust beneath Borneo. A related problem is which, if any, of the main strike-slip faults (Mae Ping, Three Pagodas and Aliao Shan-Red River (ASRR)) cross Sundaland to the NW Borneo margin to facilitate continental extrusion? Recent results investigating strike-slip faults, rift basins, and metamorphic core complexes are reviewed and a revised tectonic model for SE Asia proposed. Key points of the new model include: (1) The ASRR shear zone was mainly active in the Eocene-Oligocene in order to link with extension in the South China Sea. The ASRR was less active during the Miocene (tens of kilometres of sinistral displacement), with minor amounts of South China Sea spreading centre extension transferred to the ASRR shear zone. (2) At least three important regions of metamorphic core complex development affected Indochina from the Oligocene-Miocene (Mogok gneiss belt; Doi Inthanon and Doi Suthep; around the ASRR shear zone). Hence, Paleogene crustal thickening, buoyancy-driven crustal collapse, and lower crustal flow are important elements of the Tertiary evolution of Indochina. (3) Subduction of a proto-South China Sea oceanic crust during the Eocene-Early Miocene is necessary to explain the geological evolution of NW Borneo and must be built into any model for the region. (4) The Eocene-Oligocene collision of NE India with Burma activated extrusion tectonics along the Three Pagodas, Mae Ping, Ranong and Klong Marui faults and right lateral motion along the Sumatran subduction zone. (5) The only strikeslip fault link to the NW Borneo margin occurred along the trend of the ASRR fault system, which passes along strike into a right lateral transform system including the Baram line. ??

The electrical resistivity of these samples were measured in the temperature range from RT to 1000 K. It is observed that, The electrical resistivity of all investigated samples was decreased with the increase of temperature. The results showed that, the behaviour of the electrical resistivity have two conduction regions for basalt and granite samples. In the first region (RT to 400 K) for basalt and (RT 450 K) for granite samples, the electrical resistivity exhibits a slight decrease. In the second region (400 to 1000 K) for basalt and (450 to 1000 K) for granite samples, the electrical resistivity exhibit a rapid decrease with the increase of temperature.

abstract = {A radio magnetotelluric (MT) field data set, acquired in scalar mode, over a buried waste site has been successfully analyzed using a 3D MT inversion scheme using nonlinear conjugate gradients. The results of this analysis demonstrate the utility of the scheme where more than 4800 data points collected on multiple measurement profiles have been inverted simultaneously. The resulting image clearly detects the buried waste; when receiver profiles cross pit boundaries, the image maps the lateral extent of the pit. However, the base of the pit is poorly resolved, and depends upon the starting model used to launch the inversion. Hence, critical information on whether contamination is leaching into a resistive gravel bed lining the base of the pit, as well as the deeper geological horizons consisting of brown coal, clay, and tertiary sands, is inconclusive. Nevertheless, by incorporating within the inversion process a priori information of the background media that is host to the waste, sharper images of the base of the pit are obtained, which are in good agreement with borehole data. The 3D analysis applied in this paper overcomes previous limitations in the radio magnetotelluric (RMT) method using 2D data analysis and inversion. With 3D analysis, it is unnecessary to make assumptions regarding geological strike, and near-surface statics can be accommodated in both source polarizations. Our findings also indicate that 2D MT interpretation can overestimate the pit's depth extent. This may lead to the erroneous conclusion that the geological horizons beneath the pit have been contaminated.},

abstract = {Thirty-three seismic stations throughout Thailand were used to infer the crustal thickness, Vp/Vs ratio and Poisson's ratio of Thailand using the receiver function technique. The crustal thickness increases from around 31. km in the Shan-Thai terrane (STT) in the west to around 38. km in the Khorat Plateau (KP-ICT) located in the Indochina terrane (ICT) in the east. Similarly, the mean Vp/Vs and Poisson's ratios derived here show that Vp/Vs increases from 1.69 to 1.73 from the STT to the KP-ICT, while Poisson's ratio increases from 0.23 to 0.25 from the STT to the KP-ICT. Our results are well supported by geological evidence found at the surface. In addition, we incorporate gravity and magnetic data to constrain the crustal properties of Thailand. The low Poisson's ratios show that the crust of Thailand is mostly felsic. Only the lower crust of KP-ICT is different as it is thicker, denser and has higher mafic composition than the other terranes of Thailand. This special feature in the KP-ICT is required to explain the lower Bouguer anomaly in the KP-ICT. In addition, we interpret the crustal evolution and deformation of these terranes and compare our results with the results from the Vietnam network of the ICT.},

abstract = {Wide-band (320–	0.001Hz) and long period (0.01–0.0001Hz) magnetotelluric (MT) data were acquired along two profiles crossing the western part of the North Anatolian fault zone (NAFZ), Turkey, which consists of two main fault branches. The first profile (İzmit profile) crosses the epicentral area of the 17 August 1999 İzmit earthquake. In fact, the MT measurements along this profile started just a few weeks before the occurrence of the mainshock and four instruments happened to be in operation in the vicinity of the fault when the earthquake took place. The second profile (Adapazarı profile) is located about 30km east of the first profile. Two-dimensional modeling shows the following results. First, the hypocenters of mainshock and aftershocks are located on the highly resistive side near the edge of a conductive zone. Second, the long-period MT data show a low resistivity zone extending down to 50km between the two fault branches. Such a deep conductive zone is interpreted as representing partial melting resulted from the past complex tectonics in this region, and it is related to the non-seismic after-slip in the layer below the seismogenic zone characterized by the highly resistive layer.},

@article{Oldenburg1999,
abstract = {In this paper, the term "depth of investigation" refers generically to the depth below which surface data are insensitive to the value of the physical property of the earth. Estimates of this depth for dc resistivity and induced polarization (IP) surveys are essential when interpreting models obtained from any inversion because structure beneath that depth should not be interpreted geologically. We advocate carrying out a limited exploration of model space to generate a few models that have minimum structure and that differ substantially from the final model used for interpretation. Visual assessment of these models often provides answers about existence of deeper structures. Differences between the models can be quantified into a depth of investigation (DOI) index that can be displayed with the model used for interpretation. An explicit algorithm for evaluating the DOI is presented. The DOI curves are somewhat dependent upon the parameters used to generate the different models, but the results are robust enough to provide the user with a first-order estimate of a depth region below which the earth structure is no longer constrained by the data. This prevents overinterpretation of the inversion results. The DOI analysis reaffirms the generally accepted conclusions that different electrode array geometries have different depths of penetration. However, the differences between the inverted models for different electrode arrays are far less than differences in the pseudosection images. Field data from the Century deposit are inverted and presented with their DOI index.},

We chose a 6 km profile with 12 sites across the hot springs for carrying out a magnetotelluric (MT) survey on July 2011. A 2D inversion was applied on the determination MT data to resolve the subsurface conductive structures using a 2D inversion routine of Occam approach. The 2D model significantly illustrates the geothermal structures at depth, including cap rock (from 100 to 600 m), reservoir (from 500 to 2000 m) and the heat source (starting from 1000 m), and it shows a good correlation with the geological features. One of the interesting results is distinguishing the main faults, which are acting as the preferential paths to circulate the hydrothermal fluids. The resistivity model fits on the geological section along the MT profile.},

abstract = {The shallow, low-temperature geothermal field of Hisar, in western Turkey, was studied by means of vertical electrical sounding (VES), Wenner, self-potential (SP) and very low-frequency electromagnetic (VLF-EM) profiling surveys. The VES survey, conducted along the valley in an E-W direction, provided lithological and structural information that is in good agreement with the well data, and suggests that the field is characterized by low-resistivity values (≤30 $\Omega$ m). Because the resistivity structure in a N-S direction could not be investigated due to the rough topography towards the north, SP, Wenner and VLF-EM measurements were made to identify and characterize a possible hot-fluid carrying fault/fracture zone that forms one of the boundaries of the valley. There is a good correlation between the results of the SP, VLF-EM and Wenner surveys, which confirm the existence of the NE-SW striking fault zone that had been inferred from geologic information. Tensional fractures that developed perpendicular to the fault zone were also identified. Consistent with the results of the SP and Wenner profilings, the two-dimensional model derived from VLF-EM data and a Karous-Hjelt current density pseudo-section detected the conductive fault zones bearing the geothermal fluids. © 2006 CNR.},

abstract = {Geological, geochemical, and geophysical surveys have been conducted in the area of the Pebble CuAuMo porphyry deposit in south-west Alaska since 1985. This case study compares three-dimensional (3D) inversion results from Anglo American's proprietary SPECTREM 2000 fixed-wing time-domain airborne electromagnetic (AEM) and Geotech's ZTEM airborne audio-frequency magnetics (AFMAG) systems flown over the Pebble deposit. Within the commonality of their physics, 3D inversions of both SPECTREM and ZTEM recover conductivity models consistent with each other and the known geology. Both 3D inversions recover conductors coincident with alteration associated with both Pebble East and Pebble West. The high grade CuEqn 0.6\% ore shell is not consistently following the high conductive trend, suggesting that the SPECTREM and ZTEM responses correspond in part to the sulphide distribution, but not directly with the ore mineralization. As in any exploration project, interpretation of both surveys has yielded an improved understanding of the geology, alteration and mineralization of the Pebble system and this will serve well for on-going exploration activities. There are distinct practical advantages to the use of both SPECTREM and ZTEM, so we draw no recommendation for either system. We can conclude however, that 3D inversion of both AEM and ZTEM surveys is now a practical consideration and that it has added value to exploration at Pebble.© 2012 ASEG.},

abstract = {Recent increase in the application of 3-D inversion of magnetotelluric (MT) data is facilitated by the availability of several 3-D inversion codes, which led to improved interpretation of MT data. However, still the galvanic effects continue to pose problems in interpretation of the MT data. We have addressed this problem using the phase tensor (PT) concept and developed a scheme based on a modification of the sensitivity matrix in the 3-D inversion code of Siripunvaraporn et al., which enables us to directly invert the phase tensor elements. We have used this modified code for PT inversion of MT data and evaluated its efficacy in reducing the galvanic effects through a few examples of inversion of synthetic data and its application on real data. The synthetic model study suggests that the prior model (mo) setting is important in retrieving the true model. Comparison of results obtained from conventional impedance inversion and the proposed PT inversion method suggests that, even in the presence of the galvanic distortion (due to near-surface checkerboard anomalies in our case), the newinversion algorithm reliably retrieves the regional conductivity structurewhen the prior model or regional resistivity value level can be estimated with sufficient accuracy. Data errors were propagated to the PT elements using delta method while inverting the real data from USArray. The PT results compare very well with those from full tensor inversion published earlier, signifying the efficacy of this new inversion scheme. © The Authors 2012.

abstract = {Recent developments in the speed and quality of data acquisition using the radiomagnetotelluric (RMT) method, whereby large amounts of broadband RMT data can be collected along profiles, have prompted us to develop a strategy for routine inverse modeling using 2D models. We build a rather complicated numerical model containing both 2D and 3D elements believed to be representative for shallow conductors in crystalline basement overlain by a thin sedimentary cover. We then invert the corresponding synthetic data on selected profiles, using both traditional NIT approaches, as well as the proposed approach, which is based on the determinant of the MT impedance tensor. We compare the estimated resistivity models with the true models along the selected profiles and find that the traditional approaches often lead to strongly biased models and bad data fit, in contrast to those using the determinant. In this case, much of the bias is removed and the data fit is improved. The determinant of the impedance tensor is independent of the chosen strike direction, and once the a priori model is set, the best fitting model is found to be practically independent of. the starting model used. We conclude that the determinant of the impedance tensor is a useful tool for routine inverse modeling.},

abstract = {The radiomagnetotelluric (RMT) method utilizes man-made signals generated by distant transmitters or by dedicated local transmitters. Man-made electromagnetic (EM) signals in the 1-250-kHz frequency band come mainly from two sources: (1) distant radio transmitters operating in the 15-250-kHz band and (2) nearby or distant industrial sources emitting either transients or higher harmonics of 50 Hz. The natural or background EM signals form a kind of noise floor. In Europe for the 15-250-kHz band, there generally are sufficient transmitters available to estimate the EM transfer functions completely, i.e., the full impedance tensor and the tipper vector. We show examples of the variability of power spectra and azimuthal distributions of transmitters from sites in Sweden, Hungary, The Netherlands, and Spain. We also show that the estimated transfer functions are stable as a function of time; even under typical noisy conditions, simple stacking of spectra in narrow frequency bands provides good-quality estimates of transfer functions. ¬© 2006 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

abstract = {Electrical and electromagnetic methods are powerful tools in environmental and geotechnical investigations. Techniques developed for deeper applications, such as mining, geothermal and crustal studies, are scaled for shallow targets by moving to higher frequencies, earlier decay times and/or smaller array configurations. Another extremely important factor is dense station spacing, to reduce spatial aliasing, and high quality data to resolve small features. Hence, new instruments are concerned with making continuous or dense measurements with high precision, and interpretational methods fast enough to handle large datasets quickly. Continuously measuring electrical and time-domain electromagnetic systems have been developed for geological mapping in hydrological investigations with one-dimensional inversion routines that are rapid and robust. At a smaller scale an electrical system is used for archaeology studies with excellent results. Working to and above the upper limits of the quasi-static approximation, a very early time electromagnetic system is proving successful at mapping subsurface infrastructure in areas of conductive, clay cover, where ground penetrating radar is ineffective. Induced polarization (IP) and resistivity systems that employ multiplexing techniques, while not continuously measuring, allow for relatively rapid production rates and dense sampling for applications ranging from landfill and contaminant characterization studies, to verifying the integrity of engineered subsurface structures and monitoring infiltration in the vadose zone.},

abstract = {The size and low resistivity of the clay cap associated with a geothermal system create a target well suited for electromagnetic (EM) methods and also make electrical detection of the underlying geothermal reservoir a challenge. Using 3-D numerical models, we evaluate four EM techniques for use in geothermal exploration: magnetotellurics (MT), controlled-source audio magnetotellurics (CSAMT), long-offset time-domain EM (LOTEM), and short-offset time-domain EM (TEM). Our results show that all of these techniques can delineate the clay cap, but none can be said to unequivocally detect the reservoir. We do find, however, that the EM anomaly from a deep, conductive reservoir overlain by a larger, more conductive clay cap is caused by the presence of the electric charge at conductivity boundaries rather than electromagnetic induction. This means that, for detection of the reservoir, methods such as MT, which rely on electric field measurements, are superior to those where only the magnetic field is measured. The anomaly produced by boundary charges at the reservoir is subtle and will be evident only if high-quality data are collected at closely spaced measurement sites. LOTEM electric field measurements look promising and should be useful when efficient multidimensional tools are developed for LOTEM interpretation. Although CSAMT employs electric field measurements, this method is not recommended for reservoir detection because the anomaly caused by a deep reservoir is obscured by transmitter effects that cannot be isolated reliably. A combination of CSAMT and TEM measurements appears most appropriate for delineation of the clay cap.},

The occurrence of the thermal waters is controlled by deep tectonic fractures in the bedrock where higher-temperature geothermal reservoirs of economic interest are present. The objective of this study is to detect the deeper active hydrothermal zone under a thick sedimentary cover by geoelectrical methods. In the Gui-An site, the combination of telluric-telluric profiling and magnetotelluric methods turns out very efficient to delineate more accurately the width of the deep conductive fracture zone. Moreover, the self-potential method allows us to localize the most active geothermal zone by electrofiltration processes above a convective cell of hot water which flows up from a deep source. The combined results constitute a possible guide for deep geothermal exploration currently encountered in several geothermal regions over the world.},

abstract = {Hydrogeophysical characterization using the transient electromagnetic method (TEM) and the DC resistivity sounding (VES) method was implemented in the central part of Azraq Basin (Qa Basin), Jordan, to identify and map the spatial distribution of shallow fresh and saline groundwater in the upper aquifer systems. The alluvium (Al) and chert limestone (URC) shallow aquifers show different degrees of groundwater salinization. The range of groundwater resistivity varies from 0.06 to 10.8 ohm-m. Saline groundwater was detected at depths between 5 to 30 m where the aquifers have a wide spectrum of resistivity values from 0.14 to 120 ohm-m. The integrated geophysical and hydrogeologic models are significantly correlated in chloride concentration, groundwater resistivity, and aquifer resistivity. Using 1D inversion results from the TEM and VES soundings in addition to quasi-3D modeling (1D spatially constrained inversion) at selected TEM sites, groundwater resistivity variation was attributed to two different salinization mechanisms. First, the spatial distribution of the salt content in mud flat deposits had a significant effect on the groundwater salinity. Second, in situ dissolution of near-surface rock-forming salts occurred at areas away from the mud flat deposits. The proposed hydrogeophysical models revealed the potential effect of both mechanisms in the study area. © 2013 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

abstract = {Stromboli volcano (Italy) is characterized by a permanent mild explosive activity disrupted by major and paroxysmal eruptions. These strong eruptions could be triggered by phreatomagmatic processes. With the aim of obtaining a better understanding of ground water flow in the vicinity of the active vents, we carried out a set of geophysical measurements along two profiles crossing the Fossa area (through the Pizzo, the Large and the Small Fossa craters). These measurements include electrical resistivity, induced polarization, self-potential, temperature and CO2 ground concentration. These methods are used in order to delineate the crater boundaries, which act as preferential fluid flow pathways for the upflow of hydrothermal fluids. The absence of fumarolic activity in the Fossa area and the ground temperature close to 100 degreesC at a depth of 30 cm indicate that the hydrothermal fluids condense close to the ground surface. Part of this condensed water forms a shallow drainage network (<20 m) in which groundwater flows downslope toward a perched aquifer. The piezometric surface of this aquifer is located \&SIM;20 m below the topographic low of the Small Fossa crater and is close (< 100 m) to the active vents. Electrical resistivity tomography, temperature and CO2 measurements show that this shallow aquifer separates the underlying hydrothermal body from the ground surface. Further studies are needed to ascertain the size of this aquifer and to check its possible implications for the major and paroxysmal events observed at the Stromboli volcano.},

abstract = {In order to test the hypothesis that northeast-trending strike-slip faults partially accommodated mid-Tertiary east-west extension in northern Thailand, we investigated a prominent lineament that marks the trace of the Mae Kuang fault. The trace of the this fault follows the linear Mae Kuang Valley for approximately 30 km through the Mae Tho Range northeast of Chiang Mai, where it cuts granitic rocks of the Fang - Mae Suai batholith and roof pendants of Paleozoic terranes. Along the trace of the fault we identified offset contacts, and slickenlines on fault surfaces that suggest a total sinistral slip of 3.5 km and a dip-slip of 600 m. The fault also offsets three north-flowing tributaries to the Mae Kuang River by 400-700 m. At its southwestern end, the Mae Kuang fault is apparently truncated by the right-lateral Mae Tha fault and does not extend to the west side of the Chiang Mai Basin. Therefore, it cannot be accommodating the transfer of extension from basin to basin, however, it may accommodate small amounts of differential rotation between adjacent crustal blocks. The fault probably initiated between 20 and 5 Ma, simultaneous with the slip inversion on the Mae Ping and Red River Faults. ?? 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Only three independent measurements of apparent resistivity are theoretically sufficient to retrieve the parameters of a geolectrical model with two layers, i.e. the resistivities of the two layers and the thickness of the first one. The Three-Point Method (TPM) presented here is a rapid electrical sounding field procedure based on that principle. It consists of measuring the apparent resistivity using only three interelectrode spacings instead of some tens as for a usual vertical electrical sounding. To invert these data and check out the limits of this simplified field procedure, we use a Bayesian probabilistic formalism. Such an approach appears more effective than other traditional inversion methods because it allows to calculate exhaustively a probabilistic description of the equivalent solutions. Both synthetic and field data validate TPM when a model with two layers correctly describes the geoelectrical structure of the ground. Particularly, TPM combined with the Bayesian inversion method is a tool well-designed to rapidly characterise the overburden thickness in sedimentary contexts, or the water table depth in the case of sufficient resistivity contrast between saturated and nonsaturated materials. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.

abstract = {We present a technique for inverting controlled source audio‐frequency magnetotelluric (CSAMT) data to recover a 1-D conductivity structure. The earth is modeled as a set of horizontal layers with constant conductivity, and the data are apparent resistivities and phases computed from orthogonal electric and magnetic fields due to a finite dipole source. The earth model has many layers compared to the number of data points, and therefore the solution is nonunique. Among the possible solutions, we seek a model with desired character by minimizing a particular model objective function. Traditionally, CSAMT data are inverted either by using the far‐field data where magnetotelluric (MT) equations are valid or by correcting the near‐field data to an equivalent plane‐wave approximation. Here, we invert both apparent resistivity and phase data from the near‐field transition zone and the far‐field regions in the full CSAMT inversion without any correction. Our inversion is compared with that obtained by inverting ...},

abstract = {We use 2-D magnetotelluric (MT) problems as a feasibility study to demonstrate that 3-D MT problems can be solved with a direct solver, even on a standard single processor PC. The scheme used is a hierarchical domain decomposition (HDD) method in which a global computational domain is uniformly split into many smaller non-overlapping subdomains. To make it more efficient, two modifications are made to the standard HDD method. Instead of three levels as in the standard HDD method, we classify the unknowns into four classes: the interiors, the horizontal interfaces, the vertical interfaces and the intersections. Four sets of smaller systems of equations are successively solved with a direct method (an LU factorization). The separation significantly reduces the large memory requirements of a direct solver. It also reduces the CPU time to almost half that of the standard HDD method although it is still slower than the conventional finite difference (FD) method. To further enhance the speed of the code, a red-black ordering is applied to solve the horizontal and vertical interface reduced systems. Numerical experiments on a 2-D MT problem of a given size running on a single processor machine shows that CPU time and memory used are almost constant for any resistivity models, frequencies and modes. This is a clear advantage of our algorithm and is of particular importance if the method is applied to 3-D problems. We show that our new method results in reductions in both memory usage and CPU time for large enough domains when compared to the standard FD and HDD schemes. In addition, we also introduce a 'memory minimization map', a graphical tool we can use instead of trial-and-error to pre-select the optimal size of subdomains, which yield the best performance in both CPU time and memory even running on a serial machine. © 2010 The Authors Geophysical Journal International © 2010 RAS.},

abstract = {To create a three-dimensional (3-D) cave and cavity network model in Karst terrain from two-dimensional (2-D) direct current resistivity (DCR) profiles, we first need to recognize their effects on the inversion results from a number of special cases. 2-D and 3-D cavity models are created to demonstrate effects from (1) depth of the cavity, (2) size and shape, (3) distance to the edge of the cavity, (4) orientations (inclination and declination) of the cavity and (5) several smaller cavities lying in an array. For other complicated models, combinations of these factors can be used to infer the results. Two parallel DCR profiles from the western part of Thailand were first inverted with the 2-D inversion for interpretation. Knowledge gained from the numerical modeling on these special cases is helpful to constrain the interpretation and also to extend the interpretation to 3-D. This gives us a picture of the 3-D cave and cavity networks beneath the area of study. Two main connected cavities between these two profiles can be inferred from the data along with several local cavities near the surface. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

A comparison between the petrophysical properties of the rock and the interpretation of the hydraulic test results is proposed as a means of determining the distribution of the natural permeable fractures. Gamma-ray spectral logs and other geophysical logs (caliper, bulk density, P-wave slowness, and photoelectric factor) revealed some petrographical variations within the Soultz massive granite, as well as altered/fractured zones that act as preferential pathways for fluid flow as indicated by flow logs. Fluid losses during circulation tests have been estimated on the basis of statistical analysis of gamma-ray readings, and of potassium and thorium contents. ?? 2006 CNR.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the results of an audio-frequency magnetotelluric (AMT) survey across the Jigokudani valley, Tateyama volcano, Japan, to investigate the spatial relationship between the distribution of electrical resistivity and geothermal activity and to elucidate the geologic controls on both its phreatic eruption history and recent increase in phreatic activity. The AMT data were collected at eight locations across the Jigokudani valley in September 2013, with high quality data obtained from most sites, enabling the identification of an underground 2D resistivity structure from the transverse magnetic (TM) mode data. The data obtained during this study provided evidence of a large conductive region beneath the surface of the Jigokudani valley that is underlain by a resistive layer at depths below 500 m. The resistive layer is cut by a relatively conductive region that extends subvertically toward the shallow conductor. The shallow conductive region is divided into an uppermost slightly conductive section that is thought to be a lacustrine sediment layer of an extinct crater lake containing hydrothermal fluids and a lower section containing a mix of volcanic gases and hydrothermal fluids. The low permeability of the clay zone means that the uppermost clayey sediments allow the accumulation of gases in the lower section of the conductive region, suggesting the existence of a cap structure. The deep resistive layer likely consists of units similar to the granitic rocks that are widely exposed throughout the Jigokudani valley. We suggest that the relatively conductive zone that separates these granitic rocks represents a high-temperature volcanic gas conduit, given that the most active fumarole in the Jigokudani valley lies directly along the trajectory of this path.},

abstract = {Remote reference (RR) magnetotelluric (MT) measurements are made to reduce the bias caused by noise in electric field E and magnetic field H at a local site. RR only works when noise at a local and remote sites are uncorrelated. A study has been undertaken to find the farthest distance of a far remote site for crustal study which maintains the effectiveness of the RR technique. From theoretical studies the conditions for valid RR estimates have been obtained. The study shows that the remote site can be kept at a considerably large distance from the local site. In a field experiment a fixed local site and several remote sites have been selected at distances of 80, 115, and 215 km away in the frequency range of 30 Hz (0.03 s) to 0.00055 Hz (1800 s) at midlatitudes where the wavelengths of the source magnetic fields are long compared to the site separation. The remote sites are distributed over diverse geological settings. All the data of the fixed local site have been remote reference processed with the corresponding remote sites. The study reveals that using a remote site located at as large a distance as 215 km results in unbiased observations and remains effective in improving the MT data quality for all frequency ranges. If the data were acquired at long periods and or in the high latitudes, then to extract the stable uniform field estimates of the impedance one has to carry out robust processing technique.},

abstract = {Subsurface inhomogeneities can be classified in three categories depending on the comparison of their sizes against the effective skin depth and "adjustment distance". These categories are geological noise, local and regional inhomogeneities. Due to its random nature, geological noise leads to uncontrollable distortions of the magnetotelluric field. Such methods as curve shifting, distortion tensor techniques, decomposition and spatial filtering can effectively be used to correct for static shift caused by geological noise. It is shown that the effects of local and regional subsurface inhomogeneities reduce to static shifts of MT-curves when rather rigid conditions are satisfied. The methods used to suppress the effect of geological noise have limited applicability to local and regional inhomogeneities, which can be accurately accounted for only by modelling.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the application of artificial neural networks (ANN) technique for the study of a case history using 1-D inversion of vertical electrical resistivity sounding (VES) data from the Puga valley, Kashmir, India. The study area is important for its rich geothermal resources as well as from the tectonic point of view as it is located near the collision boundary of the Indo-Asian crustal plates. In order to understand the resistivity structure and layer thicknesses, we used here three-layer feedforward neural networks to model and predict measured VES data. Three algorithms, e.g. back-propagation (BP), adaptive back-propagation (ABP) and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) were applied to the synthetic as well as real VES field data and efficiency of supervised training network are compared. Analyses suggest that LMA is computationally faster and give results, which are comparatively more accurate and consistent than BP and ABP. The results obtained using the ANN inversions are remarkably correlated with the available borehole litho-logs. The feasibility study suggests that ANN methods offer an excellent complementary tool for the direct detection of layered resistivity structure},

Phase-tensor analysis of the AMT data shows that the region is broadly 2D. Rapid relaxation inversion (RRI) for both transverse-electric (TE) and transverse-magnetic (TM) modes has been carried out to obtain resistivity images of the subsurface. AMT results show that the north-south fault close to Bakreswar is a shallow feature, not deeper than 300 m, and thus cannot act as a heat source. The subsurface formation below the fault zone is highly resistive up to a great depth, indicating the absence of a heat source and geothermal reservoir in the vicinity of the BHS. AMT results indicate that the location of the geothermal reservoir is deep and lies beyond the profiles of measurement in the northwestern side of the Bakreswar Hot Spring.},

abstract = {There are currently three types of algorithms in use for regularized 2-D inversion of magnetotelluric (MT) data. All seek to minimize some functional which penalizes data misfit and model structure. With the most straight-forward approach (exemplified by OCCAM), the minimization is accomplished using some variant on a linearized Gauss-Newton approach. A second approach is to use a descent method [e.g., nonlinear conjugate gradients (NLCG)] to avoid the expense of constructing large matrices (e.g., the sensitivity matrix). Finally, approximate methods [e.g., rapid relaxation inversion (RRI)] have been developed which use cheaply computed approximations to the sensitivity matrix to search for a minimum of the penalty functional. Approximate approaches can be very fast, but in practice often fail to converge without significant expert user intervention. On the other hand, the more straightforward methods can be prohibitively expensive to use for even moderate-size data sets. Here, we present a new and much more efficient variant on the OCCAM scheme. By expressing the solution as a linear combination of rows of the sensitivity matrix smoothed by the model covariance (the 'representers'), we transform the linearized inverse problem from the M-dimensional model space to the N - dimensional data space. This method is referred to as DASOCC, the data space OCCAM's inversion. Since generally N << M, this transformation by itself can result in significant computational saving. More importantly the data space formulation suggests a simple approximate method for constructing the inverse solution. Since MT data are smooth and 'redundant,' a subset of the representers is typically sufficient to form the model without significant loss of detail. Computations required for constructing sensitivities and the size of matrices to be inverted can be significantly reduced by this approximation. We refer to this inversion as REBOCC, the reduced basis OCCAM's inversion. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data sets with REBOCC, DASOCC, NLCG, RRI, and OCCAM show that REBOCC is faster than both DASOCC and NLCG, which are comparable in speed. All of these methods are significantly faster than OCCAM, but are not competitive with RRI. However, even with a simple synthetic data set, we could not always get RRI to converge to a reasonable solution. The basic idea behind REBOCC should be more broadly applicable, in particular to 3-D MT inversion.},

abstract = {In the last few decades, the demand for three-dimensional (3-D) inversions for magnetotelluric data has significantly driven the progress of 3-D codes. There are currently a lot of new 3-D inversion and forward modeling codes. Some, such as the WSINV3DMT code of the author, are available to the academic community. The goal of this paper is to summarize all the important issues involving 3-D inversions. It aims to show how inversion works and how to use it properly. In this paper, I start by describing several good reasons for doing 3-D inversion instead of 2-D inversion. The main algorithms for 3-D inversion are reviewed along with some comparisons of their advantages and disadvantages. These algorithms are the classical Occam’s inversion, the data space Occam’s inversion, the Gauss–Newton method, the Gauss–Newton with the conjugate gradient method, the non-linear conjugate gradient method, and the quasi-Newton method. Other variants are based on these main algorithms. Forward modeling, sensitivity calculations, model covariance and its parallel implementation are all necessary components of inversions and are reviewed here. Rules of thumb for performing 3-D inversion are proposed for the benefit of the 3-D inversion novice. Problems regarding 3-D inversions are discussed along with suggested topics for future research for the developers of the next decades.},

abstract = {A data space approach to magnetotelluric (MT) inversion reduces the size of the system of equations that must be solved from M × M, as required for a model space approach, to only N × N, where M is the number of model parameter and N is the number of data. This reduction makes 3-D MT inversion on a personal computer possible for modest values of M and N. However, the need to store the N × M sensitivity matrix J remains a serious limitation. Here, we consider application of conjugate gradient (CG) methods to solve the system of data space Gauss-Newton equations. With this approach J is not explicitly formed and stored, but instead the product of J with an arbitrary vector is computed by solving one forward problem. As a test of this data space conjugate gradient (DCG) algorithm, we consider the 2-D MT inverse problem. Computational efficiency is assessed and compared to the data space Occam's (DASOCC) inversion by counting the number of forward modelling calls. Experiments with synthetic data show that although DCG requires significantly less memory, it generally requires more forward problem solutions than a scheme such as DASOCC, which is based on a full computation of J. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 RAS.},

Phys. Earth Planet. Interiors 150, 3–14), including modifications to allow inversion of the vertical magnetic transfer functions (VTFs), and parallelization of the code. The parallel implementation, which is most appropriate for small clusters, uses MPI to distribute forward solutions for different frequencies, as well as some linear algebraic computations, over multiple processors. In addition to reducing run times, the parallelization reduces memory requirements by distributing storage of the sensitivity matrix. Both new features are tested on synthetic and real datasets, revealing nearly linear speedup for a small number of processors (up to 8). Experiments on synthetic examples show that the horizontal position and lateral conductivity contrasts of anomalies can be recovered by inverting VTFs alone. However, vertical positions and absolute amplitudes are not well constrained unless an accurate host resistivity is imposed a priori. On very simple synthetic models including VTFs in a joint inversion had little impact on the inverse solution computed with impedances alone. However, in experiments with real data, inverse solutions obtained from joint inversion of VTF and impedances, and from impedances alone, differed in important ways, suggesting that for structures with more realistic levels of complexity the VTFs will in general provide useful additional constraints.},

Computational costs associated with construction and inversion of model-space matrices make a model-space Occam approach to 3D MT inversion impractical. These difficulties are overcome with a data-space approach, where matrix dimensions depend on the size of the data set, rather than the number of model parameters. With the transformation to data space it becomes feasible to invert modest 3D MT data sets on a PC. To reduce computational time, a relaxed convergence criterion is used for the iterative forward modeling code used to compute the sensitivity matrix. This allows reduction in computational time by more than 70\%, without affecting the inversion results.

abstract = {In this paper, we start with the implementation of a data space conjugate gradient (DCG) method for 3-D magnetotelluric (MT) data. This code will be referred to as WSDCG3DMT. It is an extension of the 2-D method previously developed. Several experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that WSDCG3DMT usually needs more computational time than the data space Occam's inversion (OCCAM) for which the corresponding code is referred to as WSINV3DMT. However, the memory requirement of WSDCG3DMT is only a fraction of that of WSINV3DMT. Based on the knowledge gained from several studies of both codes, we have created a new hybrid scheme called the DCG Occam's inversion (DCGOCC) and the corresponding code, WSDCGOCC3DMT, from combining aspects of the OCCAM and DCG methods. As with OCCAM, the DCGOCC method divides the inversion into two phases. In Phase I the misfit is brought down to a desired level. In Phase II unnecessary structures are smoothed out. Because its mathematical basis is of a similar form to that of DCG, its memory requirement is similarly low but more stable. However, DCGOCC is significantly faster than both methods. We demonstrate the computational performances with comparisons of all three methods with both synthetic and EXTECH field data sets. © 2011 The Authors Geophysical Journal International © 2011 RAS.},

The program is based on a conventional 3-D MT inversion code (Siripunvaraporn et al., 2004), which is a data space variant of the OCCAM approach. In addition to modifications required for computing Network-MT responses and sensitivities, the program makes use of Massage Passing Interface (MPI) software, with allowing computations for each period to be run on separate CPU nodes. Here, we consider inversion of synthetic data generated from simple models consisting of a 1 $\Omega$-m conductive block buried at varying depths in a 100 $\Omega$-m background. We focus in particular on inversion of long period (320-40,960 seconds) data, because Network-MT data usually have high coherency in these period ranges. Even with only long period data the inversion recovers shallow and deep structures, as long as these are large enough to affect the data significantly. However, resolution of the inversion depends greatly on the geometry of the dipole network, the range of periods used, and the horizontal size of the conductive anomaly.

abstract = {In the period from 2008 to 2012, the topic of electromagnetic (EM) induction methods applied to mineral exploration has been the subject of more than 50 papers in journals and more than 300 extended abstracts presented at conferences (about 100 of which contain developments worthy of mentioning). Most of the work at the universities has been on modelling, inversion and data processing, and most of this material is pub- lished in the refereed literature. However, academia has also undertaken work on system geometry changes, system calibration and sensor design. There have been papers describing new systems developed for mineral exploration and case histories describing the use of EM methods to directly discover mineral deposits or to map the geology. Most of this work is by the service companies and mining companies and reported in the unrefereed literature. Since 2008, the pace of development of helicopter time-domain systems has slowed and more effort has been directed to developing natural source magnetic systems and to modelling and inverting this data. A number of studies comparing the results from natural source methods with the results from artificial source methods conclude that the natural source methods can see large-scale geological structures usually when there is a weak conductivity contrast with the surrounding material, but the natural source methods are unable to see small features that have a very large conductivity contrast with the country rock. Hence, they are not a good detector of mineral deposits unless one is looking for a large porphyry system.},

abstract = {We have applied self-potential (SP) survey and long- term SP monitoring along with pumping test to delineate hydrology and to monitor deep ground water movement around test drill wells in Pohang geothermal development site, Korea. Before drilling the test wells, SP survey was carried out to figure out overall potential distribution of the site. The pumping test was performed in April 2004 for 72 hours. SP monitoring started several days before the pumping tests water with 128-channel automatic recording system. SP survey showed positive anomaly at north of the borehole, which may be an up-flow zone of the deep geothermal due to electrokinetic potential generated by hydrothermal circulation. SP monitoring during pumping test has been performed to figure out the reservoir variation and direction of fluid flow. It was not easy to see clear variations of SP according to pumping on and off since the area is covered with some 360 m- thick tertiary sediments of electrical resistivity lower than 10 ohm-m, which resulted in serious attenuation of the electrokinetic potential induced by deep groundwater flow. However, when we compared the variation of SP with those of groundwater pumped water, we could identify some parts responding to pumping. Dominant changes level and temperature of were observed in southwest of the pumping well, in which three- dimensional (3-D) magnetotelluric (MT) survey results shows low-resistivity anomaly in the depth region of 600 m-1,000 m. Overall analysis suggests that there exist hydraulic connection through the southwestern part to pumping well.},

abstract = {We study the feasibility of the application of an indirect EM geothermometer, developed recently, to the temperature extrapolation in depth using magnetotelluric data collected in the seismically active northern Tien Shan faulted area (Bishkek Geodynamic Test Site, Kyrgyzstan) and Hengill geothermal zone (Iceland). The approach used is based on the artificial neural network technique, which does not imply the prior knowledge of the electrical conductivity mechanisms on the one hand and provides temperature estimates based on the analysis of the implicit conductivitytemperature relations, on the other. The samples for neuronet teaching consisted in the well temperature records and electrical conductivity values determined for the same depths from the magnetotelluric data measured in the vicinities of eight boreholes in each testing area. The testing of the taught neuronets was carried out using the temperature records not involved in the teaching process. The results indicate that the temperature extrapolation accuracy essentially depends on the ratio between the well length and the extrapolation depth. In particular, in extrapolation to a depth twice as large as the well depth the relative error is 5 6\% and in case of threefold excess, the error is around 20\%. This result makes it possible to increase significantly the depth of indirect temperature estimation in the Earthﾒs interior (in particular, for geothermal exploration) based on the available temperature logs. The practical application of an indirect electromagnetic geothermometer could provide the following facilities: 1) more exact temperature estimation in the extrapolation mode; 2) remote temperature estimates in the boreholes in areas characterized by extreme conditions for conventional geothermometers.},

abstract = {Advances have been made in the subsurface temperature estimation basing on the indirect electromagnetic geothermometer. The approach used was based on the artificial neural network technique, which, contrary to other available approaches, does not imply the prior knowledge of the electrical conductivity mechanisms and rock properties. Application of the indirect EM geothermometer to the interwell space interpolation in three areas (Tien Shan, Kyrgyzstan; Soultz-sous-For\^{e}ts, France; and Hengill, Iceland) characterized by different geologic environments indicated that the temperature estimation errors are controlled by four factors: faulting, distance between the EM site and the area where the temperature is estimated, meteoric and groundwater flows, and lateral geologic inhomogeneity (although the latter factor is less restrictive if appropriate EM inversion tools are used). It was demonstrated that the extrapolation errors depend on two factors: spacing between the EM site and the borehole, and ratio between the well length and the extrapolation depth. In particular, the relative accuracy of the temperature extrapolation to the depths twice as large as the borehole depth did not exceed an average of 5\%. Using the indirect EM geothermometer, it was possible to reconstruct 2D and 3D temperature models of the studied areas from EM sounding data, which, in turn, enabled us to draw important conclusions regarding the dominating heat transfer mechanisms, fluid circulation paths, and better locations for drilling new boreholes. Application of the indirect EM geothermometer during exploitation of the geothermal reservoirs may enable one to monitor the variations of subsurface temperatures basing on the ground EM monitoring data and forecast future trends.},

abstract = {Four different methods of determining the DC sensitivity in three dimensions are presented: three numerical approaches for arbitrary conductivity structures and an analytical one for a homogeneous case using the sensitivity theorem. Since the sensitivity is a very important and indicative property in any interpretation process, its spatial distribution is shown as an overview for commonly used pole-pole, pole-dipole, and dipole-dipole arrangements at the surface and subsurface. Distinct regions of negative sensitivities appear for any configuration. For horizontal subsurface pole-pole configurations, they assume tube-like, cylindrical shapes stretching from the electrode locations towards the surface and yielding a circular sign-reversal pattern at the surface. These shapes and sign reversals occur as long as the electrodes are located at a finite depth. Similar forms occur for subsurface pole-dipole and dipole-dipole arrangements. A series of model studies are carried out to examine the validity of the homogeneous responses for more realistic inhomogeneous media. Generally, the spatial sensitivity patterns for homogeneous environments are good approximations for moderate conductivity contrasts not exceeding 1:10 if the source is located within conductive material. If the source is buried within a resistor, conductive structures perturb the homogeneous pattern more significantly. Finally, a crosshole model study reveals significant differences between 2-D and 3-D conductive bodies, suggesting a need to examine the target very carefully before approximating some structures in two dimensions.},

abstract = {For hydrocarbon applications, seismic exploration is the workhorse of the industry. Only in the borehole, electromagnetic (EM) methods play a dominant role, as they are mostly used to determine oil reserves and to distinguish water from oil-bearing zones. Throughout the past 60 years, we had several periods with an increased interest in EM. This increased with the success of the marine EM industry and now electromagnetics in general is considered for many new applications. The classic electromagnetic methods are borehole, onshore and offshore, and airborne EM methods. Airborne is covered elsewhere (see Smith, this issue). Marine EM material is readily available from the service company Web sites, and here I will only mention some future technical directions that are visible. The marine EM success is being carried back to the onshore market, fueled by geothermal and unconventional hydrocarbon applications. Oil companies are listening to pro-EM arguments, but still are hesitant to go through the learning exercises as early adopters. In particular, the huge business drivers of shale hydrocarbons and reservoir monitoring will bring markets many times bigger than the entire marine EM market. Additional applications include support for seismic operations, sub-salt, and sub-basalt, all areas where seismic exploration is costly and inefficient. Integration with EM will allow novel seismic methods to be applied. In the borehole, anisotropy measurements, now possible, form the missing link between surface measurements and ground truth. Three-dimensional (3D) induction measurements are readily available from several logging contractors. The trend to logging-while-drilling measurements will continue with many more EM technologies, and the effort of controlling the drill bit while drilling including look-ahead-and-around the drill bit is going on. Overall, the market for electromagnetics is increasing, and a demand for EM capable professionals will continue. The emphasis will be more on application and data integration (bottom-line value increase) and less on EM technology and modeling exercises. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {A water exploration in a karst area can be hardly imagined without the application of electrical and seismic methods, but karst areas are very difficult environments for any geophysical exploration due to very high surface nonhomogeneities. Dual gradient mapping (measurements performed at two depth levels), two-dimensional (2-D) resistivity imaging, refraction methods and high-solution reflection methods have been applied on a characteristic karst case in Croatia. General overview on the subsurface resistivity distribution has been reached by using the gradient mapping measurements. This revealed low-resistivity zone points of the fractured rock filled with water. Map of relative changes of apparent resistivities with depth discovers two different zones: Resistivity increases with depth in the eastern part and resistivity decreases with depth in the western part of the area. Weak reflections are seen in the stacked seismic reflection section placed with the 2-D resistivity imaging profile, but they can be followed along the entire profile. By combining refraction and reflection data, faulted and fractured zones can be determined at surface as well as at greater depths, which will enable a precise definition of their extensions. Two-dimensional inverse seismic modelling have been carried out to clarify significance of the main reflection horizon, which is probably caused by a lithologic boundary, meaning a contact of dolomites and compact limestones. The model of acoustic impedancies has been derived on the basis of refraction velocities, reflection velocities and geological data from borehole. An accurate geological model has been established on the basis of all the data. Two-dimensional resistivity surveying can be used very efficiently in karst water explorations of shallow targets, but for deeper targets the seismic methods can be very useful by reason of poor resolution of the electrical resistivity methods. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {It is of considerable importance to explore the geological structure around active faults, especially near-surface unconsolidated layers, to estimate the faults' activity. There are numerous case studies to investigate active faults using geophysical exploration methods; however, only a few cases have been verified in detail by comparison with other geological information. We have applied electric and electromagnetic methods, which can be effective for exploring to several hundred meters depth, to reveal geological structures covered by thick Quaternary formations at four active fault sites in Japan. In this paper, we used the controlled source audio-frequency magnetotelluric (CSAMT) method, the direct current (dc) resistivity method, and the resistivity tomography method. The resistivity profiles were analyzed by two-dimensional inversion techniques, and the resulting models were verified by comparison with geological evidence obtained by drilling or trenching. Our results are as follows. (1) CSAMT is an effective method for defining an outline of geological structures around a fault to several hundred meters deep. It enables us to define a resistivity boundary between different kinds of bedrock with a fault contact. (2) The dc resistivity method distinguishes each sedimentary unit as a different resistivity zone and detects the vertical displacement in the Quaternary formations. (3) The resistivity tomography method is useful to determine in more detail the flexure structure produced by faulting. Using these latter two methods, we can select drilling positions and trenching locations. In addition, it is verified from the data measured along trench walls and electrical logging that the resistivity of softsedimentary layers and clayey cataclastic bedrock conforms to the relationship established between the resistivity and the clay content. These resistivity methods have the advantages of detecting clayey layers as very low resistivity zones. The overall conclusion is that the combination of these resistivity methods provides us with more detailed and accurate information for estimating fault activity. ?? 2000 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Seafloor magnetotelluric (MT) observations using ocean bottom electromagnetometers (OBEMs) provide information on the electrical conductivity structure of the oceanic mantle. A three-dimensional (3-D) analysis is particularly important for marine MT data because the electric and magnetic fields observed on the seafloor are distorted by the rugged seafloor topography and the distribution of land and ocean. Incorporating topography into 3-D models is crucial to making accurate estimates of the oceanic mantle's conductivity structure. Here we propose an approximate treatment of seafloor topography to accurately incorporate the effect of topography without significantly increasing the computational burden. First, the topography (lateral variation in water depth) is converted to lateral variation in effective conductivity by volumetric averaging. Second, we compute the electric and magnetic field components used to calculate the MT responses at arbitrary points from the electric field components on staggered grids, using a modified interpolation and extrapolation scheme. To verify the performance of this approximate treatment of seafloor topography in 3-D inversions, we tested the method using synthetic seafloor datasets and both 3-D forward modeling and inversion. The results of the synthetic inversions show that a given conductivity anomaly in the oceanic upper mantle can be recovered with sufficient accuracy after several iterations.

abstract = {Electromagnetic (EM) techniques are the most commonly used geophysical methods in mineral exploration. However, the use of EM measurements for environmental and engineering applications like the detection of contaminant plumes or the exploration of waste sites is relatively new. The reason for the success of the application of EM methods to environmental problems lies in the variation of conductivity caused by different geometry of pore fluids and clay contents in rocks, and by the presence of organic and inorganic contaminants. Many EM methods/instruments used for mapping near surface geology exist and nowadays they play a central role in environmental geophysics. In general, these methods can be classified in two blocks: EM methods using a plane wave source of excitation and EM methods using a controlled source like a magnetic dipole or a loop source. The Very Low Frequency (VLF, VLF-R) and Radiomagnetotelluric (RMT) methods are chosen as representative methods for plane wave techniques, while horizontal loop EM methods operating in low induction numbers (EM31, EM34) and Transient Electromagnetic methods (TEM) are chosen as representatives of magnetic dipole or loop source techniques. Basic principles, advantages and disadvantages of each technique as well as their connection to specific environmental problems will be discussed. Different successful applications of these methods are reported in the literature. However, this review will focus on three major subjects: waste site exploration, detection of contaminated earth layers, and groundwater exploration. Case histories are presented illustrating the suitability of EM methods for solving such problems.},

abstract = {Scalar radiomagnetotelluric measurements were carried out on a contaminated test area close to the Brazi Refinery in Romania in order to detect and to monitor a 1 m thick oil layer expected at 5 m depth. Radio transmitters broadcasting in a frequency range from 10 kHz to 300 kHz were selected to observe the apparent resistivity and the phase data associated with the E- and B-polarizations. They were located parallel and perpendicular to the assumed strike direction of the contamination plume. The data were interpreted by a 2D inversion technique from which the conductivity structure of the area was derived. The 2D inversion models of all profiles on the contaminated area show a poor-conductivity zone above the groundwater table which could be associated with the oil contamination. A first attempt was also made to monitor the contaminated layer: the radiomagnetotelluric measurements were repeated on the same profiles a year later, but this time in a dry period, not in a rainy one. The 2D inversion results of the measurements in the dry period indicate that the high-resistivity layer moved closer to the surface. Additional reference measurements were then carried out on a non-contaminated area situated at a distance from the refinery, in the opposite direction to the flow of the groundwater. These reference measurements were used for the derivation of the unperturbed geology and they were also compared with the measurements of the contaminated test area. There is a significant difference in the frequency dependences of the apparent resistivities of the reference and contaminated areas, which could indicate a contamination at shallow depth. The 2D inversion results show the increase of resistivity at a depth of about 5 m beneath the contaminated area where the oil contamination is expected according to the information from the boreholes. ¬© 2005 European Association of Geoscientists \& Engineers.},

abstract = {A joint radiomagnetotelluric (RMT) and transient electromagnetic (TEM) survey was carried out on a profile over an old waste deposit in Cologne to map lateral and vertical boundaries as well as inhomogeneities within the deposit itself. For the RMT method, three pairs of frequencies between 16.4 and 198 kHz, from radio transmitters located in roughly perpendicular directions, were used. The observed apparent resistivity ($\rho$a) and phase ($\phi$) data clearly show the lateral boundary of the deposit to be characterized by strongly decreasing $\rho$a values for all frequencies. The penetration depth for the lowest frequency is about 25 m outside and only 12 m inside the deposit. The RMT data were interpreted by one- and two-dimensional inversion techniques. On the waste site there is a resistive overburden over the highly conductive waste. Inhomogeneities within the deposit could also be resolved. However, the bottom of the deposit could not be detected by the RMT method because of the low penetration depths observed over the highly conductive waste site. TEM measurements on the same profile, however, allowed to achieve exploration depths between 10 and 100 m. Interpretation using one-dimensional conductivity models indicates the lower boundary of the waste site (20 m) and completes the two-dimensional conductivity depth section of the waste deposit.},

abstract = {Radiomagnetotelluric surveys were carried out on two different waste sites in order to map them and to detect the surrounding hosts. One was filled with industrial waste and the other with household refuse. Both had been recultivated. Powerful military and civilian radiostations (10-300 kHz) located parallel and perpendicular to the strike direction of both waste sites served as transmitters. Hence, apparent resistivity and phase data were observed for several selected frequencies. Using this field setup, the data were associated to the E- and B-polarisation directions of the magnetotelluric field. The lateral borders of both waste sites are located accurately in the field. They are characterized by strongly decreasing apparent resistivities observed at nearly all frequencies at the border between the waste site and the undisturbed geology. The data were quantitatively interpreted by conductivity models using a 2D inversion algorithm. The derived 2D conductivity models give information about the vertical extent of the studied waste sites and about the structure of the surrounding hosts. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {3-D inversion techniques have become a widely used tool in magnetotelluric (MT) data interpretation. However, with real data sets, many of the controlling factors for the outcome of 3-D inversion are little explored, such as alignment of the coordinate system, handling and influence of data errors and model regularization. Here we present 3-D inversion results of 169 MT sites from the central San Andreas Fault in California. Previous extensive 2-D inversion and 3-D forward modelling of the data set revealed significant along-strike variation of the electrical conductivity structure. 3-D inversion can recover these features but only if the inversion parameters are tuned in accordance with the particularities of the data set. Based on synthetic 3-D data we explore the model space and test the impacts of a wide range of inversion settings. The tests showed that the recovery of a pronounced regional 2-D structure in inversion of the complete impedance tensor depends on the coordinate system. As interdependencies between data components are not considered in standard 3-D MT inversion codes, 2-D subsurface structures can vanish if data are not aligned with the regional strike direction. A priori models and data weighting, that is, how strongly individual components of the impedance tensor and/or vertical magnetic field transfer functions dominate the solution, are crucial controls for the outcome of 3-D inversion. If deviations from a prior model are heavily penalized, regularization is prone to result in erroneous and misleading 3-D inversion models, particularly in the presence of strong conductivity contrasts. A good' overall rms misfit is often meaningless or misleading as a huge range of 3-D inversion results exist, all with similarly acceptable' misfits but producing significantly differing images of the conductivity structures. Reliable and meaningful 3-D inversion models can only be recovered if data misfit is assessed systematically in the frequency-space domain.},

abstract = {Energy utilization is greatly affected by the laws of thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can merely be transformed from one type to another. So, if energy cannot be destroyed, why do we need new energy supplies continuously and what do we mean when we say we use energy? The answer lies in the second law of thermodynamics, which can be stated in many forms. One form of this law says that it is impossible to convert heat into work without rejecting some of that energy to a heat sink. This means that there is a thermodynamic limit to the amount of energy that be captured from energy sources. Eventually, the energy sources are degraded into less usable forms of energy. Understanding these laws is vital for understanding many of the mistakes that people make about energy. It is also vital to understand the heat engines that have powered our economies for the past 200 years.},

abstract = {A method is described for filtering magnetotelluric (MT) data in the wavelet domain that requires a minimum of human intervention and leaves good data sections unchanged. Good data sections are preserved because data in the wavelet domain is analyzed through hierarchies, or scale levels, allowing separation of noise from signals. This is done without any assumption on the data distribution on the MT transfer function. Noisy portions of the data are discarded through thresholding wavelet coefficients.The procedure can recognize and filter out point defects that appear as a fraction of unusual observations of impulsive nature either in time domain or frequency domain. Two examples of real MT data are presented, with noise caused by both meteorological activity and power-line contribution. In the examples given in this paper, noise is better seen in time and frequency domains, respectively. Point defects are filtered out to eliminate their deleterious influence on the MT transfer function estimates. After the filtering stage, data is processed in the frequency domain, using a robust algorithm to yield two sets of reliable MT transfer functions.},

abstract = {We describe the results from a combined controlled source audio magnetotelluric (CSAMT) and natural source magnetotelluric (MT) survey carried out in the Solfatara–Pisciarelli (S–P) area, located in the central part of the Campi Flegrei (CF) composite caldera, west of Naples, Southern Italy. The S–P area represents the most active zone within the CF caldera, in terms of hydrothermal manifestations and local seismicity. Since 1969, the CF caldera is experiencing ground deformation, seismicity and geochemical fluid changes, which are particularly evident in the S–P area. A 1km long, nearly W–E directed CSAMT–MT profile crossing the fumarole field was carried out in the S–P area with the aim of deducting a resistivity model of the structural setting of the hydrothermal system in the first 3km depth. An interpretation of the modelled section across the profile is given in this paper, taking advantage from already existing seismic, gravity and geochemical data in the same area. Three well distinct zones have been outlined. The first zone is a very shallow, electrically conductive body localized beneath the westernmost segment of the profile, which, within a short distance of about 100m, dips westwards from near surface down to some hundred metres in depth. Mostly accounting for the very low resistivity (1–10$\Omega$m) and the exceedingly high values of vP/vS (>4), this shallow zone has been ascribed to a water-saturated, high-pressurized geothermal reservoir. The second zone, which has been localized below the west-central portion of the CSAMT–MT transect, appears as a composite body made up of a nearly vertical plumelike structure that escapes at about 2.25km depth from the top edge of the east side of a presumably horizontal platelike body. The plumelike structure rises up to the free surface in correspondence of the fumarole field, whereas the platelike structure deepens at least down to the 3km of maximum exploration depth. The combined interpretation of resistivity (50–100$\Omega$m), body wave velocity ratio (vP/vS<2.0), mass density contrast ($\Delta$$\sigma$<0g/cm3), and geochemical data indicates that the plumelike portion can likely be associated with a steam/gas-saturated column and the platelike portion with a high temperature (>300°C), over-pressurized, gas-saturated reservoir. Finally, the third zone, which has been localized beneath the eastern half of the transect, from about 1.2km down to about 3km of depth, is also characterized by very low resistivity values (1–10$\Omega$m). Jointly interpreted with seismic (vP/vS<1.73) and gravity (⨂⌠>0g/cm3) data, this last electrically conductive structure appears to be associated with a hydrothermally mineralized, clay-rich body.},

abstract = {Unconformity-type deposits supply a significant amount of the world's uranium and consist of uranium that is generally codeposited with graphite in a fault zone. The low resistivity of the graphite produces a significant contrast in electrical resistivity, which can be located with electromagnetic (EM) methods. The Athabasca Basin in Western Canada hosts significant uranium deposits, and exploration in deeper parts of the basin has required the application of new EM methods. This paper presents an evaluation of the audiomagnetotelluric (AMT) exploration method at the McArthur River mine in the Athabasca Basin. AMT data were collected at 132 stations on a grid, and two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) inversions were used to generate resistivity models. These models showed two major results: (1) a significant conductor coincident with a major basement fault (P2) and the uranium deposits (this conductor begins at the unconformity at a depth of 550 m and extends to a depth of at least three km) and (2) a resistive halo which might be caused by the silicification associated with mineralization. However, synthetic inversions showed that this halo could be an artifact of smoothing function in the inversion scheme. The 2D inversions were validated by synthetic inversions, comparison with the 3D inversion models, and correlation with well-log information. 3D AMT forward modeling showed that strong 3D effects are not present in the AMT impedance data. Induction vectors showed more evidence of complexity, but the inclusion of these data in the inversion improved subsurface resolution. © 2006 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

abstract = {It has long been recognized that the Kii Peninsula in the southwest Japan arc is peculiar in a non-volcanic region, indicated by the presence of high temperature hot springs, high terrestrial heat flow and high 3He content in hot spring gases. Geophysical and geochemical studies were carried out to understand the geotectonic environment in the southern part of the Kii Peninsula. Most of the measured 3He/4He ratios are similar or higher than air, indicating wide spread incorporation of mantle-derived helium into meteoric water. A region with rather high 3He/4He ratios (>4 RA) on the west side of the Omine Mountains coincides with the occurrence of high temperature hot springs. A deep crustal resistivity structure across the Omine Mountains was imaged by wide-band magnetotelluric soundings. A 2-D inversion with N–S strike using both TM and TE modes reveals two conductors, one in the upper (3–7 km depth) and the other in lower crust (25–35 km depth) to the west of the Omine Mountains. The distribution of microearthquakes and low-frequency tremors, and the existence of seismic reflectors indicate that the large conductor in the lower crust is related to aqueous fluids derived from the Philippine Sea plate. The upper-crustal conductive zone may also reflect the aqueous fluids trapped in the upper crust, which are presumably derived from the subducting slab. Considering the occurrence of seismic events in the subducting slab beneath the southern Kii Peninsula, the aqueous fluids generated by dehydration of the slab mantle could plausibly include MORB-type helium derived from the residual lithospheric mantle. Therefore, the high temperature hot springs and high 3He emanations in hot spring gases and other geotectonic events in the southern Kii Peninsula may be due to heat flux and mantle-derived helium discharged from aqueous fluid in the upper crust.},

abstract = {The long term disposal of radioactive waste in an underground repository requires the detailed geological evaluation of a potential site. Owing to their inherent sensitivity to the presence of fluids in rocks, electromagnetic (EM) methods have an important role in this assessment. Controlled-source EM techniques are especially useful in strong anthropogenic noise environments such as industrial locations. However the complexity of modeling and inversion can limit the quantitative interpretation of controlled-source EM data. A potential radioactive waste disposal site at Sellafield in Great Britain has been investigated using a variety of EM exploration techniques. Controlled-source audio-frequency magnetotelluric (CSAMT) data have given the best subsurface information in an environment that has a high level of cultural noise. One-dimensional inversions of the Sellafield CSAMT data were found to be inadequate; 2.5-D forward modeling and inversion were used to interpret the data. The resulting resistivity models show good agreement with well log data collected at the site. These resistivity models show the presence of a large zone of hypersaline groundwater extending 1 km inland towards the potential repository and indicate the effect of faults on the hydrogeology.},

abstract = {Finite difference (FD) and finite element (FE) approximations are two commonly used methods for solving Poisson's equation from a known electrical resistivity model. FD discretizes the model with rectangular blocks, while FE discretizes it with right triangular elements. The advantage of FD is that it requires less computational time and memory storage, while the advantage of FE is its ability to handle topography. Here we introduce a hybrid FD-FE algorithm which requires less computational resources than a typical FE algorithm but can still handle topography. The model is first discretized as FD rectangular blocks. Some of these FD rectangular blocks beneath topographical features are replaced with FE right triangular elements. A system of equations for the hybrid method is then formed according to the types of discretization used. The system is a linear combination of the FD and FE equations. All three methods are applied to several models with and without topography. Comparisons in terms of computational time, memory and accuracy show that, as expected, FD is a better choice when modeling without topography, whereas FE is more practical when modeling with topography. However, our developed hybrid FD-FE method is efficient in both circumstances. Without topography, it behaves exactly like FD. With topography, it is as accurate as FE but its speed and memory usage are slightly larger than FD. In addition, we describe a scheme for automatic mesh generation. This scheme has led to another variant method, a mixed grid hybrid method. Our hybrid scheme and the automatic grid generation can be used for slopes of up to 75° This hybrid method can be further extended and implemented for 3D DC resistivity modeling for more efficient computation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {For efficient inversion code, the forward modeling routine, the sensitivity calculation, and the inversion algorithm must be efficient. Here, the hybrid finite difference-finite element algorithm, which is fast and accurate even when the slope of the topography is greater than 45°, is used as the forward modeling routine to calculate the responses. The sensitivity calculation is adapted from the most efficient adjoint Green's function technique. Both of these algorithms are then driven with the data space Occam's inversion. This combination of modules makes it possible to obtain an efficient inversion code based on MATLAB for two-dimensional direct current (DC) resistivity data. To demonstrate its efficiency, numerical experiments with our code and with commercial software are performed on synthetic data and real field data collected in the western part of Thailand where limestone and cavities dominate the region. In general, our code takes substantially longer than the commercial code to run but converges to a solution with a lower misfit. The result shows that the efficiency of our code makes it practical for real field surveys. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The constraints are built using Delaunay triangulation, which ensures automatic adaptation to data density variations. Model parameter information migrates horizontally through spatial constraints, increasing the resolution of layers that would be poorly resolved locally. SCI produces laterally smooth results with sharp layer boundaries that respect the 3D geological variations of sedimentary settings. SCI also suppresses the elongated artifacts commonly seen in interpretation results of profile-oriented data sets.

abstract = {Thermal modeling down to great depth, e.g. down to the Mohorovicic discontinuity, requires representative values of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity at an appropriate depth. Often there is a lack of data, especially concerning temperature and pressure dependence of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity, due to missing or questionable data from boreholes. Studies of the temperature and pressure dependence of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity showed that temperature is dominating. Thus measurements on a set of magmatic, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks sampled from different depth levels of the Eastern Alpine crust were used to obtain an estimate of the temperature dependence of both properties––at least for the area of investi- gation––and to give a review of the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity (k), thermal capacity (qcp) and thermal diffusivity (j) for different types of rock. The temperature dependence of thermal conductivity for crystalline (magmatitic and metamorphic) rocks is different to that of sedimentary rocks. Using the approach that the thermal resistivity (1=k) is a linear function of temperature whose slope increases with kð0Þ, the conductivity at a temperature of 0 C, two general equations were determined. The equation for crystalline rocks was verified in the temperature range of 0–500 C and the equation for sedimentary rocks was tested in the temperature range from 0 to 300 C. A general equation for the temperature dependence of k for Eastern Alpine rocks can thus be formulated: kðTÞ¼ 0:99þTðab=kð0ÞÞ kð0Þ with empirical constants and corresponding uncertainties a ¼ 0:00300:0015 and b ¼ 0:00420:0006 for crystalline rocks.

abstract = {A geophysical survey was conducted in Cambodia to measure the contribution of geophysics to a running drilling programme. The geology of the area (the province of Siem Reap) mainly consists of recent heterogeneous sediments of sand, silt and clay. The thickness of this formation ranges from 20 to 100 m and lies on Jurassic to Tertiary rocks. Surveys were done with direct current methods [one-dimensional vertical electrical sounding (ID VES), and two-dimensional (2D) electrical imaging], time domain electromagnetic (TDEM) sounding and proton magnetic resonance sounding (MRS). To validate the geophysical results, boreholes were drilled and tested with electrical logs and pumping tests. We found that: (1) The resistivity methods (VES, 2D electrical imaging and TDEM) are very sensitive to the groundwater electrical conductivity which is highly heterogeneous within the province. A preliminary relationship between measured groundwater conductivity and aquifer resistivity is proposed. (2) The MRS gives accurate information on groundwater occurrence for the 5- to 60-m-deep layers. A preliminary relationship between MRS data (aquifer transmissivity estimated from MRS field measurements) and hydrodynamic parameters (aquifer local transmissivity and borehole relative specific capacity estimated from borehole pumping tests) is proposed. (3) The resistivity methods and MRS are complementary, and a joint use is recommended. (4) At the survey scale, the borehole success rate was improved from 56\% to 90\% by the use of geophysics. Crossing the technical and cost analyses, we propose a geophysical methodology to implement boreholes in the province of Siem Reap. This methodology could both increase the borehole success rate and save money at the programme scale. It consists of the use of: (1) MRS, TDEM and electrical methods jointly where the borehole success rate is less than 30\%. (2) MRS and TDEM jointly where the borehole success rate ranges from 30\% to 50\%. (3) Electrical methods (VES and 2D electrical imaging) as standard methods. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {In this study, we qualitatively analyze detailed gravity and broadband magnetotelluric data in and surrounding the Menengai volcano of the East African rift in Kenya to assess geothermal potential of the region. Three-dimensional gravity models obtained by inverting residual gravity anomalies and 2D resistivity models obtained by inverting the transverse electric and transverse magnetic magnetotelluric modes show several common features. Our models show that a low-resistivity zone above a higher resistivity zone correlates with a low-density region located 1–4 km beneath the volcano. These zones may be related to a high temperature gradient or hydrothermally altered, fractured rocks. Additionally, a low-resistivity (>20 ohm-m) and a low-density region located approximately 4–6 km below the volcano may be related to molten material that is the source of heat for the geothermal system. The low-resistivity (<20 ohm-m) regions that correlated with a denser (2.8–2.9 g/cc) region within the caldera are bounded by high-resistivity (>250 ohm-m), high-density (>2.9) volcanic units implying that the dense and electrically resistive volcanic material is relatively cool and lacks significant fluid content that can lower resistivity. At shallow depths, 0.5–1.5 km below the caldera, a low-resistivity and low-to-moderate density region is interpreted as a zone with high fracture density that consists of clay minerals resulting from hydrothermal alteration. These results agree well with the results from previous seismic studies on the depth of the suggested molten rocks.},

The numerical simulation results in evaluations on the quantities of the HDR geothermal resource in Rehai and Yangbajing geothermal fields. The paper shows that there is abundant HDR geothermal resource with large exploitation value in China. If developed with a power capacity of 1??108 kW, the Rehai and Yangbajing fields along would be able to generate electricity for 1560 years. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An exploratory 3-D model of the electrical conductivity structure of the Australian continent is presented. The model is derived from the inversion of vertical magnetic-field transfer functions from the Australia-wide Array of Geomagnetic Stations. Crustal conductivity anomalies evident in the model are consistent with those previously mapped by independent magnetometer array studies and new electrical structures are suggested in the upper mantle. The model represents a seamless continent-scale basis for further models likely to be derived from subsequent studies. The model reveals three upper-mantle enhanced-conductivity anomalies beneath Archaean cratonic regions and two upper-mantle anomalies beneath Phanerozoic terranes in eastern Australia. Two of these anomalies have been investigated by recent magnetotelluric (MT) surveys, one in the Yilgarn Craton-Officer Basin-Musgrave Block the other in the Gawler Craton region, and are consistent with the MT results. Across much of central Australia enhanced conductivity at depths of 50-100 km is observed in the model. This region corresponds well with a recognized seismic velocity gradient at 75-100 km. Conductivity differences are also observed beneath Archaean cratons in Western Australia. The Pilbara Craton is represented as an enhanced conductivity anomaly at about 100 km, corresponding well with the lowervelocity anomaly evident in surface wave tomography models. The Yilgarn Craton is imaged as a low-conductivity body, with conductivity two orders of magnitude lower than the Pilbara Craton, continuing to greater depths. © Commonwealth of Australia (Geoscience Australia) 2013.

abstract = {Simulated annealing (SA) is used to invert 1D controlled source audio-frequency magnetotelluric (CSAMT) data. In the annealing process, the system energy is taken as the root-mean-square fitting error between model responses and real data. The model parameters are the natural logarithms of the resistivity and the thickness in each layer of the earth. The annealing temperature decreases exponentially, while the model is refreshed randomly according to the temperature and is accepted according to a Boltzmann probability. We first tested the SA on synthetic data and developed a cooling schedule of model updates specifically for CSAMT data inversion. The redesigned cooling schedule reduces the magnitude of the model updating, and makes the solution converge rapidly and stably. For a three-layer model whose resistivity increases with depth, SA has difficulty in obtaining the global solution for the middle layer. However, the solution for such a layer can be significantly improved by using the mean value of the estimates. The inversion of field data from a northern suburb of Beijing, China, demonstrates that starting from a 1D smooth inversion to determine the range of SA parameters permits the SA to obtain very good results from the CSAMT survey data.},

abstract = {Electrical resistivity may contribute to progress in enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) by imaging the geometry, bounds and controlling structures in existing production, and by monitoring changes in the underground resistivity properties in the vicinity of injection due to fracture porosity enhancement. To these ends, we are acquiring a dense grid of magnetotelluric (MT) stations plus contiguous bipole array profiling centered over the east flank of the Coso geothermal system. Acquiring good quality MT data in producing geothermal systems is a challenge due to production related electromagnetic (EM) noise and, in the case of Coso, due to proximity of a regional DC intertie power transmission line. To achieve good results, a remote reference completely outside the influence of the dominant source of EM noise must be established. Experimental results so far indicate that emplacing a reference a distance of 65 miles from the DC intertie in Amargosa Valley, NV, is still insufficient for noise cancellation much of the time. Even though the DC line EM fields are planar at this distance, they remain coherent with the nonplanar fields in the Coso area so that remote referencing produces incorrect responses. We have successfully unwrapped and applied MT times series from the permanent observatory at Parkfield, CA, and these appear adequate to suppress the interference of the artificial EM noise. The efficacy of this observatory is confirmed by comparison to stations taken using an ultra-distant reference east of Socorro, NM. Operation of the latter reference was successful by using fast ftp internet communication between Coso Junction and the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, using the University of Utah site as intermediary, and allowed referencing within a few hours of data downloading at Coso.},

abstract = {An extensive tensor controlled-source audiomagnetotelluric (CSAMT) survey has been carried out over the Sulphur Springs geothermal area, Valles Caldera, New Mexico. Forty-five sites were acquired using two crossed transmitter bipoles placed approximately 13 km south of the center of the survey. The soundings in the Sulphur Springs area were arranged in four profiles to cross major structural features. To curtail spatial aliasing, the electric bipoles along each profile were deployed contiguously. The frequency range of acquisition was 4096 Hz down to 1 Hz for the central line, but only down to 4 Hz for most sites of the other lines. CSAMT and magnetotelluric (MT) data taken outside Valles Caldera were constrained by drill logs and imply resistive Bandelier Tuff, underlain by conductive Paleozoic sediments, and further underlain by resistive, primarily Precambrian crystalline rocks. Model cross-sections within the caldera were derived using 2-D parameterized inversion constrained by drilling, with layered-earth inversion for starting models. Southeast of the Sulphur Creek fault, the upper 200 m of the section are of relatively low resistivity and correspond to unconsolidated land-slide and debris flows. The Bandelier Tuff below exhibits higher but variable resistivities because of alteration controlled by local faulting. Beneath the Bandelier Tuff, the Paleozoic sedimentary layer is only moderately less resistive than it is outside the caldera, with the lowest values occuring northwest of Sulphur Creek. Its low resistivity per se does not necessarily represent a hydrothermal aquifer. The Sulphur Creek fault appears to be a locus of substantial change in structural relief; upthrow of stratigraphy and basement to its west appears to be about 400-500 m. A major normal fault down to the southeast is located under the topographic expression of Freelove Canyon, which is up to 1 km farther southeast than suggested by previous geologic sections. High resistivities possibly corresponding to a vapor zone in the upper 500 m near VC-2B and VC-2A are not consistent with the CSAMT data.},

abstract = {We have developed and implemented a robust and practical scheme for anisotropic 3D acoustic full-waveform inversion (FWI). We demonstrate this scheme on a field data set, applying it to a 4C ocean-bottom survey over the Tommeliten Alpha field in the North Sea. This shallow-water data set provides good azimuthal coverage to offsets of 7 km, with reduced coverage to a maximum offset of about 11 km. The reservoir lies at the crest of a high-velocity antiformal chalk section, overlain by about 3000 m of clastics within which a low-velocity gas cloud produces a seismic obscured area. We inverted only the hydrophone data, and we retained free-surface multiples and ghosts within the field data. We invert in six narrow frequency bands, in the range 3 to 6.5 Hz. At each iteration, we selected only a subset of sources, using a different subset at each iteration; this strategy is more efficient than inverting all the data every iteration. Our starting velocity model was obtained using standard PSDM model building including anisotropic reflection tomography, and contained epsilon values as high as 20\%. The final FWI velocity model shows a network of shallow high-velocity channels that match similar features in the reflection data. Deeper in the section, the FWI velocity model reveals a sharper and more-intense low-velocity region associated with the gas cloud in which low-velocity fingers match the location of gas-filled faults visible in the reflection data. The resulting velocity model provides a better match to well logs, and better flattens common-image gathers, than does the starting model. Reverse-time migration, using the FWI velocity model, provides significant uplift to the migrated image, simplifying the planform of the reservoir section at depth. The workflows, inversion strategy, and algorithms that we have used have broad application to invert a wide-range of analogous data sets.},

The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the hidden, but fundamental relationship between w(lambda) and the underlying conductivity structure sigma(z). The most important criterion for classifying the conductivity structure is the existence of moments of w(lambda): if all moments exist, sigma(z) consists of a finite or infinite number of thin sheets; the sheet parameters are obtained from orthogonal polynomials associated with the weight function w(lambda). If no moment (or only a finite number of moments) exists, sigma(z) contains sections with a piecewise continuous conductivity structure, possibly covered by thin sheets. In both cases, the spectrum may be continuous, completely discrete or a mixture of both. The great variety of possible spectral functions is illustrated by a plethora of examples. The present investigation has no immediate impact on practical inversion because the unstable determination of w(lambda) is mostly circumvented in the inversion of experimental data. Therefore, the rich morphology of the spectral function generally has escaped our attention.},

A three-dimensional (3-D) inversion algorithm based on the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) and finite difference forward modelling has been applied to generate a subsurface model of complex resistivity. The lateral extents of the waste zone are well resolved. Limited depth extent is recognized, but the bottom of the waste appears too deep. With a modelling experiment, the intrinsic polarizability of the waste material is determined. Since IP is a technique for detection of diffuse occurrences of metallic material, this method holds promise as a method to distinguish buried waste from conductive soil material.

abstract = {Petrophysical interpretation of resistivity measurements is often hindered by the dependence of resistivity on the intercon- nected pore fluids and the interconnected pore surfaces. Induced polarization (IP) measurements yield parameters that are only controlled by the interconnected pore surfaces, thereby offering the opportunity to constrain interpretation of resistivity mea- surements. Using a database composed of 63 sandstone and unconsolidated sediment samples covering nine independent in- vestigations, we identified a strong linear relationship between the real part of surface conductivity ($\sigma$ 0surf ) determined from mul- tisalinity ($\sigma$w) resistivity measurements and the imaginary con- ″ ductivity ($\sigma$ ″) measured with IP at a frequency of about 1 Hz. We found $\sigma$ ∕$\sigma$ 0surf ¼ l ¼ 0.042 with a coefficient of determina- tion (R2) of 0.911 and a standard deviation of l of 0.022. We found a similar relation when the normalized chargeability (from Debye decomposition) of the frequency dependence of the IP response is used instead of $\sigma$ 0. By estimating the true formation factor (F) recorded at high salinity, we solved for $\sigma$ 0surfð$\sigma$wÞ and found that it parallels the salinity dependency ″ of the imaginary conductivity, $\sigma$ ð$\sigma$wÞ, as reported in recent studies. We also found that the value of the l determined from this experimental study was generally consistent with predic- tions of the POLARIS model when the mobility of the ions in the Stern layer was assumed to be 1∕350 of the mobility of the ions in the diffuse layer (considered equal to the mobility of the ions in the bulk solution).We discovered howthe identified relationship can be used to significantly improve (1) the estima- tion of the true formation factor and (2) the groundwater conduc- tivity, from a single salinity resistivity measurement when an IP measurement is alsomade. The approach offers an opportunity to improve estimation of porosity, formation factor, and salinity in well logging and hydrogeophysical investigations. INTRODUCTION},

Resistivity traversing has been particularly successful in defining subsurface areas of higher salinity by providing a two-dimensional image of the bulk resistivity structure. The results of the resistivity surveys are supported by bore water chemistry, which show evidence of saltwater mixing. Bores on beachfront properties have concentrations of up to 1\% seawater. A resistivity formation factor has been derived to allow the pore fluid resistivity to be estimated for future coastal surveys. The results also illustrate the problems associated with using standard models to predict the location of the saline interface when small amounts of diffusive mixing occur. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An accurate and efficient 3-D finite-element (FE) forward algorithm for DC resistivity modelling is developed. First, the total potential is decomposed into the primary potential caused by the source current and the secondary potential caused by changes in the electrical conductivity. Then, the boundary value problem for the secondary field and its equivalent variational problem are presented, where the finite-element method is used. This removes the singularity caused by the primary potential, resulting in an accurate 3-D resistivity model. Secondly, I introduce the row-indexed sparse storage mode to store the coefficient matrix and the shifted incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient (SICCG) iterative method to solve the large linear system derived from the 3-D FE calculation. The SICCG method converges very quickly and requires much less computer storage, while the traditional ICCG or modified ICCG (MICCG) method usually fails for an irregular grid. The SICCG method is more efficient than the direct method, i.e. the elimination solver with the banded Cholesky factorization. Also, it has an advantage over the symmetric successive overrelaxation preconditioning conjugate gradient method. Numerical examples of a three-layered model with high conductivity contrast and a vertical contact show that the results from the secondary potential FE method agree well with analytic solutions. With the same grid nodes, much higher accuracy from the solution of the secondary potential than those solving the total potential can be achieved. Also a 3-D cubic body is simulated, and the dipole-dipole apparent resistivities agree well with the results from other methods. By defining the analytical solution of a vertical contact as the primary potential, a more complicated model with several 3-D inhomogeneities near the vertical contact is simulated. The presented method also obtains good results for this model.},

abstract = {The quantitative interpretation of induced polarization (IP) data in a complex three-dimensional (3D) environment is a very challenging problem. The analysis of IP phenomena is usually based on models with frequency dependent conductivity distributions. In this paper, we develop a technique for 3D nonlinear inversion of IP data based on the Cole-Cole relaxation model. Our method takes into account, though in an approximate way, the nonlinearity of electromagnetic induction and IP phenomena, and inverts the observed data for the Cole-Cole model parameters. The solution of the 3D IP inverse problem is based on both smooth and focusing regularized inversion, which helps to generate more reliable images of the subsurface structures. The method is tested on synthetic models with anomalous conductivity and intrinsic chargeability, and is also applied to a practical 3D IP survey. We demonstrate that both the electrical conductivity and the chargeability distributions, as well as the other parameters of the Cole-Cole model, can be recovered from the observed IP data simultaneously. The recovered parameters of the Cole-Cole model can be used for the discrimination of the different types of mineralization, which is an important goal in mineral exploration. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Geothermal energy source, one of the viable renewable energy sources, has encouraging potential to generate full base-load electricity, which has not been explored so far in Pakistan. Though the country can be benefited by harnessing the hydro-geothermal options of energy generation in areas where sources exist, but most of these sources lie in extreme remote and inaccessible rugged mountainous ranges away from the urban-industrial centers. On the other hand, the present study shows that the HDR geothermal option is one of the most viable renewable sources considering the tectonic setup of Pakistan. Results of the study highlight the HDR geothermal energy prospects at relatively deeper depths than hydro-geothermal resources in water-free condition. The basement tectonic analyses reveal that the HDR prospects could be found even just below the urban-industrial centers of Pakistan where there are no hot springs and/or geysers like southern Indus basin in Sindh province or the Kharan trough in the western Balochistan province. Presence of high earth-skin temperature gradient trends derived from satellite temperature data and the high geothermal gradient anomalous zone derived from scanty data of bottom-hole temperatures of some of the oil and gas exploratory wells, indicates encouraging prospects for HDR energy sources in southern Indus and Thar Desert regions inclusive of Karachi synclinorium area. These high geothermal gradients have been inferred to be the result of the deep-seated southern Indus and the Thar fossil-rift structures. Moreover, the prospects of the HDR geothermal energy sources have also been inferred in the Chagai Arc region and the Kharan-Panjgur tectonic depression in the western part of Pakistan based on the analysis of integrated geophysical data. If HDR prospects are developed, they can offer the sustainable, CO2-free and independent of time, of day, of weather or season, and the base-load energy-generation resource. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We have developed rapid 3-D dc resistivity forward modeling and inversion algorithms that use conjugate gradient relaxation techniques. In the forward network modeling calculation, an incomplete Cholesky decomposition for preconditioning and sparse matrix routines combine to produce a fast and efficient algorithm (approximately 2 minutes CPU time on a Sun SPARC-station 2 for 50 × 50 × 20 blocks). The side and bottom boundary conditions are scaled impedance conditions that take into account the local current flow at the boundaries as a result of any configuration of current sources. For the inversion, conjugate gradient relaxation is used to solve the maximum likelihood inverse equations. Since conjugate gradient techniques only require the results of the sensitivity matrix A[underaccent undertilde [below] or its transpose A[underaccent undertilde [below] T multiplying a vector, we are able to bypass the actual computation of the sensitivity matrix and the inversion of A[underaccent undertilde [below] TA[underaccent undertilde [below] , thus greatly decreasing the time needed to do 3-D inversions. We demonstrate 3-D resistivity tomographic imaging using pole-pole resistivity data collected during an experiment for a leakage monitoring system near evaporation ponds at the Mojave Generating Station in Laughlin, Nevada.},

abstract = {Most 3-D magnetotelluric (MT) inversions are classified as a regularized inversion with a smoothness constraint. These inverse algorithms provide smooth solutions but cannot clearly image sharp geo-electrical interfaces. In this paper, we introduce the minimum gradient support (MGS) functional to regularize the 3-D MT inverse problem. This functional has a property whereby the functional seeks a structure with minimum volume containing large conductivity gradients. Therefore, the MGS functional can be used to search for a model with a sharp boundary. We apply the MGS functional to 3-D MT inversion to obtain a clear and accurate image of geo-electrical interfaces. In addition, the modified scattering equation approach introduced in the modified iterative dissipative method (MIDM) is applied to forward calculation, which is based on integral equation (IE) formulation and allows us to efficiently reduce the time required for forward calculation with high accuracy. The quasi-Newton iterative method is used to optimize the objective functional. It is a kind of iterative method with simplified calculation of the inverse Hessian matrix using Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) update. The convergence of this iterative method is guaranteed with inexact line searches. We also modify the adaptive approach for optimum selection of the regularization parameter so as to fit the inverse algorithm of this study. Three synthetic models are investigated, and the obtained results are compared with those obtained by a smoothing inversion. Based on the comparison, we confirm that the MGS inversion can provide higher resolution when geo-electrical interfaces are sharp. This property will help us to determine reliable electrical structures by the MT exploration method.},

This paper describes the evolution of the conceptual and technical foundations of EM methods. It outlines a framework for further development, which should focus on multitransmitter and multireceiver surveys, analogous to seismic data-acquisition systems. Important potential topics of future research efforts are in the areas of multidimensional modeling and inversion, including a new approach to the formulation and understanding of EM ﬁelds based on ﬂux and voltage representation, which corresponds well to geophysical experiments involving the measurement of voltage and ﬂux of electric and magnetic ﬁelds.},
