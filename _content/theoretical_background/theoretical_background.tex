\chapter{Theoretical Background}
\label{chap:background}

In this chapter, the theoretical background used in this work is given.
We start with magnetotellurics and focus on the MT impedance tensor, and its rotational invariant attributes. Then we describe the Berdichevsky average which is used to estimate the regional structure. Lastly, the principle and mathematical formulation of galvanic distortion are provided.
